     <html:p>This document lays out the features and requirements for the Eclipse <html:a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Galileo_Simultaneous_Release">Galileo Simultaneous Release</html:a>.</html:p>
   </introduction>
   <release_deliverables>
     <html:p>Galileo will provide an artifact and content repository for those Eclipse projects listed within this plan.  Alternatively, Galileo will be available in the form 
     of packages from the <html:a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epp">Eclipse Packaging Project</html:a>, and via a p2-based custom installer (tentative).</html:p>

   <target_environments>
     <html:p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments.
The Galileo package depends upon on the Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java. The 3.5 release of the Eclipse Platform 
Project is written and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted to run on version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment, 
Standard Edition. Eclipse Platform SDK 3.5 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. Galileo includes additional projects 
which currently require Java 5, such as EMF.  Therefore, Galileo will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform. 
Those available will be presented on the Galileo download site.</html:p>
     <internationalization>
       <html:p>The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK 
       components, including dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles. 
       As a result, the Galileo will provide English strings in its default bundles and be localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Babel project. 
       This plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and the time frame for availability.</html:p>

   <themes_and_priorities>
     <preamble>
       <html:p>The Galileo simultaneous release is a collection of Eclipse projects and therefore delivers the cumulative themes and priorities 
       of its participants, along with a set of participation requirements.  These are listed below, while individual project status on the participation 
       requirements can be found by examining each umbrella requirement listed below.  TODO: or, add a link to a query for each that displays a report?

      	<description><html:p>Projects that are part of Galileo agree to abide by the following requirements. Note: the EMO will remove projects that do not meet the required constraints.</html:p></description>
