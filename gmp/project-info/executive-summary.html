The project is proceeding well and is scheduled to release version 1.0 as part the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/callisto.php">Callisto</a> release, scheduled for
the end of Q2 2006.  Refactoring and enhancement of the runtime contribution is underway, 
as is the development of the tooling of GMF. A <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmf/tutorial/index.php">tutorial</a> 
is posted to illustrate GMF's capabilities and to solicit feedback from the community.  It is expected that 
given the popularity of the project, the strong team in place, and the reasonable goals outlined 
in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmf/development/plan.php">project plan</a>, 
GMF will successfully exit Incubation in Q2 of 2006.
