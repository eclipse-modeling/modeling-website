<p>The GMF Runtime is an industry proven application framework for creating graphical editors using EMF and GEF.</p>
<p>The GMF Runtime provides many features that one would have to code by hand if using EMF and GMF directly.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>A set of reusable components for graphical editors, such as printing, image export, actions and toolbars and much more.</li>
<li>A standardized model to describe diagram elements, which separates between the semantic (domain) and notation (diagram) elements.</li>
<li>A command infrastructure that bridges the different command frameworks used by EMF and GEF.</li>
<li>An extensible framework that allows graphical editors to be open and extendible.</li>
</ul></p>
