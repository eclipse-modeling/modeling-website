   <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a> is a pragmatic implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) MOF Model to Text Language (MTL) standard.
</p>
<p>
You do not need to be an expert to start using the plug-ins and create your first code generator : 
using the provided example projects and the powerful completion feature of the Acceleo editor, 
it is very easy to get started once you understand the basic principles.

If you don't know anything about Acceleo, you can start with a little demo

Acceleo.org was created 4 years ago, and as the time goes, the Team has been more and more convinced that the MOF Model To Text OMG specification was the way to go for the project.
We started to code a reference implementation for the standard within the Eclipse M2T project.
We have managed to provide nice tooling, simple syntax and efficient code generation with all the pragmatism we had about Acceleo.org.
There aren't a lot of differences between the old version of acceleo and the new one.

For Acceleo lover, you will find in Eclipse Acceleo everything you have loved in the Acceleo.org version and more.
This specification is really a good one <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/">http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/</a>

At the moment, those who need a perfect stability must continue to use the Acceleo.org version (2.x).
As time goes on, Eclipse Acceleo is better and better and you can already have a try right now (3.0).
That said, we still need some few month to get the same stability level between our current stable version and the new one.
The next generation Acceleo will be ready for the next Eclipse simultaneous release (Helios).
For Helios, this is the first time we plan to graduate under Eclipse. We have recently grown the version number from 0.9.0 to 3.0.0 
because the last release of Acceleo outside of Eclipse was the 2.7.0 version (Acceleo.org)
