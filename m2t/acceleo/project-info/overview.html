	<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a> is a pragmatic implementation of the
	<a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group (OMG)</a> <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/">
	MOF Model to Text Language (MTL)</a> standard.

	You do not need to be an expert to start using the plug-ins and create your first code generator : using the provided
	example projects and the powerful completion feature of the Acceleo editor, it is very easy to get started and
	understand the basic principles.

<p>
	You can get a quick glance at Acceleo with the demonstration that was presented
	<a href="http://www.obeo.fr/videos/acceleo-eclipse/eclipse-modeling-runaway-acceleo.htm">at the Eclipse Modeling
	Runaway 2010</a>.

	The <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a> project was started 4 years ago. Over the years, it
	steadily grew from its first stable release up to its 2.x versions. Yet, the team has been more and more
	convinced that the future of code generation lied in the OMG <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/">MTL</a>
	specification, and that it was the way to go for the project. The reference implementation we provide within the
	Eclipse M2T project, Acceleo 3.0, combines nice tooling, simple syntax and efficient code generation with all the
	pragmatism we had with the 2.x stream.
