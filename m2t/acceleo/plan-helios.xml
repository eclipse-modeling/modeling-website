   <introduction>
     <html:div>
     This document lays out the feature and API set for the 3.0.0 release of the M2T Acceleo project.  
     The Acceleo component is an open source component under the Eclipse Modeling / Model-To-Text (M2T) project.
     Its primary goal is to provide an implementation of the MOF Model-To-Text OMG standard.
     For Helios, this is the first time we plan to graduate under Eclipse. We also plan to grow the version number from 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 because
     the last release of Acceleo outside of Eclipse was the 2.7.0 version (Acceleo.org). We are also in the process of transferring the community,
     and for a community point of view, it is clearer to graduate and set the new Eclipse version as 3.0.0.

   <release_deliverables>
	<html:p>
    The release deliverables have the same form as is found in most Eclipse projects, namely:
	<html:ul>
		<html:li>Acceleo SDK (includes runtime and tooling components, with sources, examples, and documentation) (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
		<html:li>Acceleo runtime binary distribution (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
		<html:li>Acceleo examples (downloadable and update site)</html:li>
		<html:li>Acceleo tests (downloadable and update site)</html:li>
	</html:ul>
	</html:p>
    </release_deliverables>
   <release_milestones>
      <preamble>
         <html:div>
         The implementation will be compliant with the advanced feature compliance level of the MOF Model-To-Text OMG language (No Macro and alternative syntax).
         Acceleo will synchronize its release milestones with the Helios release schedule.

   <target_environments>
     <html:div>
     The acceleo project depends upon on the Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java.
     Acceleo will be available on Eclipse Ganymede, Galileo, and Helios. 
     EMF is used by the Acceleo execution engine for accessing the models. 
     The MDT-OCL component is reused to edit, parse, and interpret OCL as a sub-language of Acceleo. 
     acceleo will target the same Java version as EMF, which currently requires Java 5.
     Eclipse Platform SDK 3.6 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. 
     Acceleo will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform. 
     </html:div>
          <internationalization>
          <html:div>
          <html:p>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis
for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided
by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default
resource bundles. As a result, the Acceleo
project will provide English strings in its default bundles and be
localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Platform. This
plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and
the time frame for availability.
