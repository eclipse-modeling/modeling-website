    <p>The <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Texo">Texo</a> project provides annotation driven code generation for server-side web application environments. Texo supports XML/XMI persistence, JSON serialization and automatic JPA persistence. New annotationn systems will be added in subsequent releases. The code generation generates annotated code (and other artifacts) based on annotated models. The developer can easily override default behavior by providing annotations in the model. Texo will support JPA and other annotation sets. The Texo generated code can support runtime model driven development by providing access to the model at runtime.
