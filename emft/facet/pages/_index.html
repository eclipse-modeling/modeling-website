<h3>EMF Facet</h3>
<div id="introText">

<p>The Eclipse Modeling Project focuses on the evolution and
promotion of model-based development technologies within the Eclipse
community by providing a unified set of modeling frameworks, tooling,
and standards implementations. EMFT is part of this Eclipse Modeling
Project and is about incubating new technologies that extend or
complement EMF.</p>

<p>Tools based on EMF use Ecore as a common standard to represent
the data manipulated by the tool. Data is described in terms of a set of
entities, attributes, relations and operations. Extending the data
structure used by an EMF tool (e.g. adding a new entity, attribute,
relation or operation) implies modifying its Ecore definition, and thus,
changing its source code.</p>

<p>Extending existing EMF tools without changing their Ecore
definition (and therefore, without requiring to change their source
code) would facilitate their customization to fit specific needs. To
allow for this kind of extension, EMF needs a mechanism to dynamically
create viewpoints that extend and combine existing Ecore definitions
without having to modify them.</p>

<p>EMF Facet aims to allow this kind of extension by providing a
mechanism to dynamically add attributes, references and operation to
existing Ecore definitions without having to modify them. A part of this
tooling will be imported from the project MoDisco.</p>
