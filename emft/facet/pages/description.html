<p>EMF Facet is a solution to extend existing Ecore metamodels without having to modify them.</p>

<p>The idea is to provide non-intrusive mechanisms to add new features (types, attributes, operations and references) to a metamodel and to customize the existing features by adding extra properties (icons, label, etc.)</p>

<p>These mechanisms are based on a query abstraction framework to be able to use all the kind of queries independently of their implementation language (Java, OCL, ATL, JXPath, etc.)</p>

<p>A part of this tooling will be imported from the project MoDisco.</p>
