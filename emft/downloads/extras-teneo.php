	<h3>Build Compatibility</h3>
		<p style="padding-left:10px">Teneo has two different current builds: the Integration-build (the build id starts with an I) and the 
		Stable-build (the build id starts with an S). Both builds are made from the same source tree and all bug fixes and new functionality
		is present in both builds. The I- and S-build are compatible with different versions of EMF/Eclipse:</p>
		<p style="padding-left:10px"><b>I-build (0.8.0/1.0.0):</b> this build is for Eclipse 3.3/EMF 2.3</p>
		<p style="padding-left:10px"><b>S-build (0.8.0/1.0.0):</b> this build is for Eclipse 3.4/EMF 2.4</p>
		<br/>
	<p style="padding-left:10px">Teneo has recently moved from version number 0.8.0 to 1.0.0 as part of the process to graduate Teneo from
	incubation to a mature project.</p>
	<p style="padding-left:10px">The I-0.7.5 build is for Eclipse 3.2 and EMF 2.2. However this build/branch is not actively maintained.</p>
