<h2>[General] Main themes</h2>
<h2>[General] Team philosophy</h2>
<p>The MTF team works on a colaborative basis. This means that by
becoming a comitter you take responsibility not only for your own code
but for the whole project.</p>
<p><i>Code ownership is explicitly not desired!</i></p>
<p>You are allowed to do what ever you think is necessary to bring
the project closer to the main themes. Generally, this means that it is
important to get a feel for when things need to be discussed and when
you can do the changes without up-front discussion. When new to the team
it's best to watch how the others act in order to get that feel.</p>
