<p>The <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Ecore_Tools">Ecore Tools</a> component provides a complete environment to create, edit and maintain Ecore models.
This component eases handling of Ecore models with a Graphical Ecore Editor and bridges to other existing Ecore tools (Validation, Search, Compare, Emfatic, generators...).
The Graphical Ecore Editor implements multi-diagram support, a custom tabbed properties view, validation feedbacks, refactoring capabilities...
The long-term goal is to provide the same level of services as does JDT for Java.</p>
