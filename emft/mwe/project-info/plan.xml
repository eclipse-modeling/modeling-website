   <introduction>
     This document lays out the feature and API set for the first release of the MWE component,version 0.7.0, of the EMFT Project.  
     This project plan inherits from the Modeling Project Plan, which should be referenced when consulting this individual project plan.

   <release_deliverables>
     <html:p>
    The release deliverables have the same form as is found in most Eclipse projects, namely:
<html:ul>
<html:li>MWE source code release, available as versions tagged "R0_7" in the project's CVS repository.</html:li>
<html:li>MWE SDK (includes runtime and tooling components, with sources, examples, and documentation) (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>MWE runtime binary distribution (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>MWE tests (downloadable and update site)</html:li>
</html:ul>
  </html:p>
    </release_deliverables>
   <release_milestones>
      <preamble>
      <html:p>Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals and follow the Platform milestone releases by approximately 2 weeks; 
      that is, until the final 3.5 release of the Platform, upon which MWE and other projects will release simultaneously. 
      As MWE is dependent upon the EMF, and other projects, which are scheduled to release milestones within 1 week of Platform milestones, 
      MWE will deliver its milestones within the following week. 
      It is anticipated that MWE will synchronize its release milestones with the Galileo release schedule.

   <target_environments>
     In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments.
The MWE project depends upon on the Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java. 
The 3.5 release of the Eclipse Platform Project is written and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java Platform APIs, 
and targeted to run on version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. 
MWE will target the same Java version as EMF, which currently requires Java 5.
Eclipse Platform SDK 3.5 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. 
MWE will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform. 
Those available will be presented on the project download site.
     <internationalization>
       The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
       The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages, are externalized. 
       The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles. 
       As a result, the MWE project will provide English strings in its default bundles and be localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Platform. 
       This plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and the time frame for availability.
     </internationalization>

   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
