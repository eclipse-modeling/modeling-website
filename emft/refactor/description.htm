<p>
	EMF Refactor is an open source component under <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/">Eclipse EMFT</a> to provide extensible tool support for generating and applying refactorings of EMF based
models, e.g. UML EMF models.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	EMF Refactor will consist of 
	<ul>
		<li>a <strong>Refactoring Generation Module</strong> for specifying EMF model refactorings using several model transformation approaches,
		<li>a <strong>structured suite</strong> of predefined EMF model refactorings, and
		<li>a <strong>Refactoring Application Module</strong> for applying EMF model refactorings in a uniform and user-friendly way.
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A first community technical preview is targeted in spring 2010.
	</p>
