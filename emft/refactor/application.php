			<p>This manual presents the application of a EMF model refactoring using <b>EMF Refactor</b>. More precisely, we demonstrate the model refactoring <b>Move EAttribute</b> for Ecore models. Please note, that EMF Refactor can be used for refactorings of any models whose meta model is based on EMF Ecore.</p>
			<p>First, please take a look to the following Ecore diagram presenting a first model concerning EMF model refactorings in an early stage of the EMF Refactor development process. A <i>ModelRefactoring</i> has a name and conforms to a <i>MetaModel</i> that is specified by name, namespace prefix, and namespace URI. Furthermore, it has a label that should be shown as an <i>Entry</i> in the <i>ContextMenu</i> of an arbitrary <i>ModelElement</i>. A <i>ModelElement</i> belongs to a <i>Model</i> that is specified by a name and stored in a file with a specific name. Furthermore, a <i>Model</i> conforms to a <i>MetaModel</i> and each <i>ModelElement</i> is typed over a specific <i>MetaModelType</i> belonging to the corresponding <i>MetaModel</i>. Besides the afore mentioned attributes, each <i>ModelRefactoring</i> is related to a <i>MetaModelType</i> representing the type of the contextual element the refactoring can be applied on.</p>

			<p>During software design it became questionable whether attribute <i>label</i> of class <i>ModelRefactoring</i> could be better placed in class <i>Entry</i>. So, model refactoring <b>Move EAttribute</b> is the next task to be performed. Since <b>EMF Refactor</b> can be used on arbitrary EMF based models the application of a specific refactoring is mainly triggered from within the EMF instance editor. The next figure shows the example model from above using this tree-based editor.</p>
