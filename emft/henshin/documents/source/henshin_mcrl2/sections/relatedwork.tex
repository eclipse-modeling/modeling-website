In the \moment~\cite{Boronat2009} tool, verification of graph transformation systems
%is implemented using rewriting logic in \maude~\cite{maude}. Formal analysis 
is supported using OCL invariant checking and LTL model checking. To distinguish between different instances of the same type in an LTL formula, node identities must be encoded using ID-attributes which must be defined already in the initial state. Thus, only nodes which are already included in the start graph can be distinguished in the model checking. To the best of our knowledge, existential and forall-quantification over node types are also not supported.
%
Another tool for LTL and CTL model checking of graph transformation systems is \groove~\cite{rensink06}. Model checking in \groove is based on atomic propositions which are defined using graph patterns. An atomic proposition is fulfilled for a given state graph iff the pattern can be matched. Therefore, it is not possible to reason about specific instances or to quantify over node types.

% \mcrl. \groove itself does not support probabilistic model
% checking and also does not integrate with PRISM. However,
% a toolchain for stochastic analysis of graph grammars
% defined in \groove is considered in~\cite{HGM06}.

% bisimulation-preserving abstractions using graph

% The former is also supported by
% \groove. Moreover, \groove can handle infinite state spaces
% using so-called shape graphs. However, this abstraction is
% not bisimulation-preserving.

% AGG~\cite{Taentzer04} is a modeling and verification tool for
% attributed graph grammars with support for critical pair
% analysis~\cite{HKT02} and termination checks~\cite{EE05}.
% Similarly to GROOVE, AGG is based on graphs and cannot model
% containment references of EMF models. Therefore, AGG's
% analysis tools cannot be applied to EMF model
% transformations in general.
