Henshin is an in-place model transformation language for the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</a>.
It supports direct transformations of EMF model instances (endogenous transformations), 
as well as generating instances of a target language 
from given instances of a source language (exogenous transformations). 
The main features are:
<ul>
<li>Support for endogenous as well as exogenous transformations</li>
<li>Natural treatment and efficient in-place execution of endogenous transformations</li>
<li>Graphical syntax</li>
<li>Support for static analysis of transformations</li>
</ul>
