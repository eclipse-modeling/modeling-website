<h1>Henshin - Bank Account Example</h1>

<p>
This example shows some basic concepts of the Henshin transformation
language and tool environment. The example transformation is <i>endogenous</i>,
meaning that it operates on a single metamodel. We explain how to define
transformation rules using Henshin's integrated graphical editor, and
how to use the Interpreter Wizard to execute rules on an example model.

<h2>Metamodel and Instance Model</h2>

<p>
<a href="examples/bank/bank.png"><image src="examples/bank/bank.png" align="right" width="300" /></a>
The metamodel is defined in the file <i>bank.ecore</i>. We used 
the Ecore Tools to draw a diagram (depicted on the right). 
The diagram is stored in the file <i>bank.ecorediag</i>.
</p>

<p>
The class <i>Bank</i> serves as a root container for
all other classes. Every bank owns a number of accounts,
each with a unique ID and the current credit 
Two types of persons are distinguished: managers and clients.
Every client is associated with at most one manager and can
own a number of accounts in the bank. Note that the references
between <i>Account</i> and <i>Client</i>, and <i>Manager</i>
and <i>Client</i> are bidirectional. Therefore, it is for example
not only possible to obtain all accounts of a given client,
but also to find out to which client a given account belongs to.

An example instance model is depicted on the right using
the Sample Reflective Ecore Model editor. It contains one
manager, three clients and four accounts. Note that
we did not generate code from the metamodel. Thus, we
use dynamic EMF here, i.e. the instance model is typed
over a dynamic metamodel loaded from <i>bank.ecore</i>.
This is also the reason why we used the generic file
extension <i>*.xmi</i> here and not, say, <i>*.bank</i>.
