<h1>Henshin Example: Dining Philosophers</h1>

<p>
<small><i>contributed by Christian Krause</i></small>
</p>

<p>
We use the simple dining philosophers example here to give an intuition about the 
rule-based modeling in Henshin and to conduct a benchmark for the state space generation tool.
</p>

<h3>Transformation System</h3>

<p>
The transformation consists of four rules shown below.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
In rule <i>left(p)</i> philosopher <i>p</i> picks up his left fork, and analogously for the rule <i>right(p)</i>. In rule <i>release(p)</i> the philospher <i>p</i> releases his fork again. The most interesting rule is <i>createPhilosopher(x)</i> where <i>x</i> refers to the highest philosopher ID in the model (note that Henshin can find all parameters automatically here). The rule <i>createPhilosopher(x)</i> can be used to dynamically add a philosopher to the table and to link it to its neighbors. We use this rule to derive initial models for different numbers of philosophers below.
</p>

<h3>Benchmark</h3>

<p>
We conducted a benchmark to measure the speed of the state space generator.
The models and the source code for the example can be found 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/svnroot/modeling/org.eclipse.emft.henshin/trunk/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.henshin.examples/src/org/eclipse/emf/henshin/examples/diningphils">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The following benchmark was conducted on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.50GHz with 8GB of main memory using Henshin 0.9.2.
We measured the time to generate the full state space.
