<h1>Henshin Example: Dining Philosophers</h1>

<p>
We use the simple dining philosophers example here to give an intuition about the rule-based modeling in Henshin and to conduct a benchmark for the state space generation tool.
</p>

<p>
The transformation consists of four rules shown below.

</p>

<p>
In rule <i>left(p)</i> philosopher <i>p</i> picks up his left fork, and analogously for the rule <i>right(p)</i>. In rule <i>release(p)</i> the philospher <i>p</i> releases his fork again. The most interesting rule is <i>createPhilosopher(x)</i> where <i>x</i> refers to the highest philosopher ID in the model (note that Henshin can find all parameters automatically here). The rule <i>createPhilosopher(x)</i> can be used to dynamically add a philosopher to the table and to link it to its neighbors. We use this rule to derive initial models for different numbers of philosophers below.

The following benchmark was conducted on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.50GHz with 4 cores and 8GB of main memory. 
The benchmark was run using these JVM parameters: "-Xms7G -Xmx7G". All times are in milliseconds. We measured the
time to generate the full state space.
