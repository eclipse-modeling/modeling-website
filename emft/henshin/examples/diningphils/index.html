<h1>Henshin Example: Dining Philosophers</h1>

<p>
We use the simple dining philosophers example here to give an intuition about the rule-based modeling and Henshin and to conduct a benchmark for the state space generation tool in Henshin.
</p>

<p>
The transformation consists of four rules shown below.

<p>
The following benchmark was conducted on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.50GHz with 4 cores and 8GB of main memory. 
The benchmark was run using these JVM parameters: "-Xms7G -Xmx7G". All times are in milliseconds. We measured the
time to generate the full state space.
