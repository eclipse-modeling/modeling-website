   <introduction>
     <html:div>JCRM is currently in the incubation phase and in the process to develop the community and the technology. Because of that it does not yet have release milestones.</html:div>

     <preamble>
         <html:div>The prototypes for different areas of JCRM are available. One can try them out using the tutorial provided in the JCRM wiki (http://wiki.eclipse.org/JCR_Management#Try_it_out). The next step is to make it easier for users to understand JCRM and to get feedback. More concrete I will give a presentation at the Eclipse Summit Europe in November 2008, create a screencast and create a Survey Monkey survey.</html:div>
