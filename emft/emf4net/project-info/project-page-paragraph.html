<p><a href="http://www.emf4net/">EMF4Net</a> tries to provide a EMF core runtime for the .Net platform
	and a C# code generation facility. EMF4Net should enable the generation of C# code from
	existing Ecore models and allow to use that code in a similar way the Java code generated
	by EMF can be used today.</p>
