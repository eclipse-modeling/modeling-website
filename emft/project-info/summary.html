<p>
The Eclipse Modeling Framework Technology project was initiated to incubate new technologies that
extend or complement EMF. 
</p>

<p>
Because EMFT is an incubator, it does not have annual coordinated releases; 
however, individual components may choose to participate in Eclipse's annual
release train or to align its development plan with that of another Modeling project such as EMF or MDT. 
</p>
<p>Contributions are currently being offered
relating to model comparison, JCR management, search, persistence and more.
