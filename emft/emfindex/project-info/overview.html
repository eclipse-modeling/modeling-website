<p>EMF Index is an extensible framework for indexing 
EMF-based models and instances. It includes components for collection 
index data, persisting index data and querying without loading any EMF 
resources. 
</p>
<p>Work on the EMF Index project has just begun, so there is currently 
no documentation. We plan to add it as soon as the API and implementation 
has matured.</p>
