    <target_environments>
      <html:div>
In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments. 
The EEF project depends upon on the Platform, which is mostly "pure" Javaâ„¢. The 3.6 release of the Eclipse Platform Project 
is written and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted to run on version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. 
EEF rely on EMF Core which is written and compiled against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs.,
EEF relies on Java 5. 
Eclipse Platform SDK 3.6 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. 
EEF will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform.

Given that there is no operating system dependent code in EEF, it's expected that EEF will work anywhere the Eclipse Platform does.
     </html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, 
including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. 
The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles. 
Similarly, the EEF project will externalize all its user interface elements,
provide English strings for them in its default bundles, 
and localize a subset of the locales offered by the Platform. 
The download page will provide the details as the become available.
