<p>This project aims at giving another way to improve the EMF model creation phase by providing new services dedicated to editing and using 
more appealing editing elements. The way to obtain these services and elements is based on a generative approach similar to the EMF.Edit one.
The framework provides advanced editing components for the properties of EMF elements and a default generation based on standard metamodels 
using these components. The generic generators create a standard architecture with advanced graphical components to edit EMF model objects. </p>
