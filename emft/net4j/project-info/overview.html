	<p>Net4j is an extensible client-server system based on the Eclipse Runtime and the Spring Framework.
	You can easily extend the protocol stack with Eclipse plugins that provide new transport or application protocols. Net4j's 
	focus on performance and scalability is featured by non-blocking I/O, zero-copy signals and multiplexed binary protocols. 
	Net4j was originally developed to support the CDO technology for distributed shared and persistent EMF models but can 
	also multiplex your own user-supplied application protocols through the same socket connection.</p>
