Temporality is a feature providing  
automatic versioning of model instances. The basic idea is to provide a Temporal
mix-in base class that can be pulled into existing models. By simply
extending the Temporal mix-in base class existing modeled types are
supplied with temporal features. i.e.: they will keep track of changes
made to the value of their attributes and references.
