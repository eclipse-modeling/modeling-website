Temporality is an open source component in the Eclipse Modeling
Framework Technology (EMFT) project whose goal is to add automatic
version of model instances. The basic idea is to provide a Temporal
mix-in base class that can be pulled into existing models. By simply
extending the Temporal mix-in base class existing modeled types are
supplied with temporal features. i.e.: they will keep track of changes
made to their attributes and references.
