<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Temporality">Temporality</a> is a feature providing 
automatic versioning of model instances. The basic idea is to provide a Temporal
mix-in base class that can be pulled into existing models. By simply
extending the Temporal mix-in base class existing modeled types are
supplied with temporal features. i.e.: they will keep track of changes
made to the value of their attributes and references.
</p>

<p>
The temporality feature consist of a temporal.ecore model containing the Temporal EClass.
 This model can be loaded using the Load Resource menu into an existing model to add 
 temporality to existing modeled EClass. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a simple model of a Fleet and Car given the ability to keep track of versions of their instances by extending the Temporal base class.

Here's a snapshot of a generated instance editor for this Fleet model. Both the Fleet and Car can be added to the resource. In this snapshot we see one fleet and two cars at the root of the resource.

<p>
With the context menu you can change the current date to 14:00 hours. The viewer now displays
 the new current date at the top of the view.

<p>
Normal mode looks just like the standard editor except for the display
of the current date at the top of the viewer. When the current date is
changed the view displays the state of the objects at the given time.
For example at 14:00h the fleet has a car in its vehicles list. But at
16:00h it did not.
</p>
 
<p>
With the context menu you can also change the viewing mode. In advanced mode the viewer displays the underlying plumbing that
 makes versioning possible. The 
VersionHolder has a list of all the past and future versions. Each
temporal object has one VersionHoder with one continuity and several
versions. There's a many-to-one relationship between Temporal and VersionHolder.
