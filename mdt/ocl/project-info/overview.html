<p>The OCL component provides the following capabilities to support OCL integration.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Defines APIs for parsing and evaluating OCL constraints and queries on EMF models.</li>
	<li>Defines an Ecore implementation of the OCL abstract syntax model, including support for
	    serialization of parsed OCL expressions.</li>
	<li>Provides a Visitor API for analyzing/transforming the AST model of OCL expressions.</li>
	<li>Provides an extensibility API for clients to customize the parsing and evaluation
	    environments used by the parser.</li>
</ol>
<p>The OCL parser is generated by the LALR Parser Generator, a SourceForge project,
licensed under the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">EPL v1.0</a>.
Download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpg/">LPG home page</a>.
This site includes the generator executable required to regenerate the parser code.</p>
