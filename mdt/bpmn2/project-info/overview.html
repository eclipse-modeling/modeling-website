<p>The objectives of the BPMN2 component are to provide
<ul>
  <li>an open source "reference" implementation of the BPMN 2.0 specification</li>
  <li>an EMF-based foundation on which business process modeling tools can be built</li>
  <li>a basis for integrating and interchanging artifacts between business process modeling tools</li>
  <li>a forum for engaging the community in validation of the BPMN 2.0 specification</li>
  <li>an opportunity for increased collaboration between Eclipse and the OMG</li>
</ul></p>
