<p>SBVR is a proposed open source component of the Model Development
Tools (MDT) subproject to provide a metamodel implementation and sample
tools based on the adopted <a
	href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/apps/doc?smsc/08-01-06"> Semantics
of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR)</a> OMG specification.</p>
<p>
The objectives of the SBVR component are to provide:
<ul>
  <li>an open source "reference" implementation of the SBVR specification</li>
  <li>an EMF-based foundation on which business vocabulary and business rules modeling tools can be built</li>
  <li>a basis for integrating and interchanging artifacts between business vocabulary and business rules tools</li>
  <li>a forum for engaging the community in validation of the SBVR specification</li>
</ul>

In addition to an implementation of the SBVR metamodel, this component
will include sample tools that aid in testing and validating the
metamodel implementation, and that help SBVR newcomers to better
understand its use and potential.
<ul>
  <li>Project Explorer navigator view for business vocabularies and rules</li>
  <li>Import business vocabulary from UML domain models</li>
  <li>Code generation to Platform-Independent Model (PIM) technologies, such as UML and OCL</li>
</ul>
