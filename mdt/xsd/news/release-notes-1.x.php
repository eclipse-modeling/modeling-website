&#160;</p>

<ul>
<li>Better JET encoding support has been added. UTF-8 encoded
templates are supported now. (Bugzilla <a

<li>The org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jet.JETSkeleton.java class has been
changed to generate code with platform-specific linefeeds.
(Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24371">24371</a>)</li>

<li>The org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jmerge.JMerger.java class has been
changed to accommodate platform-dependent line separator
character(s).</li>

<li>The org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEMap.java class has been
updated to fix a recursive cycle bug encountered when using the
putEntry(Entry entry, Object value) method to put a new value to an
existing key.</li>

<li>The org.eclipse.emf.common.util.URI.java class has been updated
to handle resolution of JAR-scheme URIs. Also, comparison of
schemes has been made case-insensitive in all URI operations,
including testing equality.</li>

<li>Changes have been made to handle xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation
in XML and XMI instance documents. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39440">39440</a>)</li>

<li>The setAttribValue(EObject object, String name, String value)
in the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.impl.XMLHandler.java class has
been changed to properly handle qualified attributes.</li>

<li>The org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.celleditor.FeatureEditorDialog.java
class has been modified to make it more generally useful. A new
constructor has been added that enables you to instantiate a
FeatureEditorDialog that can be used to edit any set of values that
are passed to it during construction, rather than the values of a
specified feature of a specified EObject. The new constructor is
used by the createPropertyEditor(Composite composite) method in the
org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.provider.PropertyDescriptor.java class,
which fixes a problem that can occur when using an
ItemPropertyDescriptorDecorator to customize a multi-valued
property.</li>

<li>Drag and drop for the generated editor has been fixed on Linux.

been changed so that it doesn't return the root if it's not
supposed to, even if the hasNext() method hasn't been called.

<ul>
<li>The eBasicSetContainer(InternalEObject newContainer, int
newContainerFeatureID, NotificationChain msgs) method in the

href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39707">39707</a>)</li>

<li>The version numbers for the plugins in the feature.xml files
have been updated to 1.1.1. Additionally, in the feature.xml file
for the org.eclipse.emf feature, the following updates have been
made in the requires element: 

<ul>
<li>in the import element for the org.eclipse.core.resources

<li>REMOVING_ADAPTER notification is now used to remove children
recursively.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">(Bugzilla <a

<li>Importing a Rose model containing a reference from a class to
another class that is stereotyped &lt;&lt;datatype&gt;&gt; is now
supported. Previously, this would result in a ClassCastException.
(Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41993">41993</a>)</li>

<li>EMF now avoids generating methods that collide with feature
methods. For example, suppose that you have an interface A, and
that A extends an interface containing a method with the signature
Foo getFoo(). If A also has an attribute named foo of type Foo,then
the accessor method with the signature Foo getFoo() would collide
with the method from the parent interface. In this case, the
generated interface A will contain only one Foo getFoo() method.
Further, the implementation of the Foo getFoo() method in the
generated AImpl.java class will be that for the accessor method.
(Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38602">38602</a>)</li>

<li>The package name resolution algorithm in the method
resolve(EModelElement eModelElement, String typeName, boolean
recordDemandCreatedEDataType) in the
org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.JavaEcoreBuilder.java class has been
improved. (Bugzilla <a

<li>The braceLine attribute in the
org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jmerge.JMerger.java class has been changed
to escape the brace. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=45182">45182</a>)</li>

<li>EMF now throws a PackageNotFoundException if you try to
reference a Resource that references an unregistered package.

<ul>
<li>XMI files created by the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi plugin are
now saved with a system-specific line separator. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36913">36913</a>).</li>

<li>You can now use the empty String ("") as the default value for
a String attribute in your Rose model.</li>

<li>EMF now writes the .ecore and .genmodel files using UTF-8 as
the encoding when the default Java locale's language is not
English.</li>

<li>EMF can now read a Rose .mdl file created by a Japanese version
of Rose (Rose 2001A.04.00 Japanese version). (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36651">36651</a>).</li>

<li>The EMF code generator now supports classes (or more generally
types) whose names end in "Impl". (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35952">35952</a>).</li>

<li>A number of improvements have been made to the XSD to Ecore
conversion, including improvements in the ability to parse
according to the originating schema.</li>

<li>The implementation for dynamic EMF has been reworked to be
faster and to use less space.</li>

<li>We have introduced org.eclipse.emf.common.util.DelegatingEList,
org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.impl.DelegatingNotifyingListImpl, and
org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.DelegatingEcoreEList to allow clients to
wrap an existing list implementation that they may have as the
"backing store" for a list that implements all the correct EMF
behaviors.</li>

<li><b>Important!</b> Template changes to improve performance and
to ensure that dynamic EMF works properly for multiple inheritance
will be picked up only if clients regenerate their models, so it is
recommended but not required that clients regenerate.<br />

<b><a name="emf_110e">Build 20030513_0618VL: Bug Fixes and Improvements</a></b> 

<p>There are numerous bug fixes and improvements included with this
build, some of which are described below. Where the description
applies to a fix for a bug reported through Bugzilla, the Bugzilla
number is included after the description. You can link directly to
the Bugzilla bug using this number.<br />
&#160;</p>

<ul>
<li>The method URI.createDeviceURI is deprecated in favor of using
URI.createURI which will always recognize a leading device
component just as URI.createDeviceURI did previously. We ask that
clients remove uses of createDeviceURI so that we can remove the
method from a subsequent drop. In general, any deprecation warning
should be eliminated in anticipation of the support
disappearing.</li>

<li>The feature order of serialized instances is now preserved when
going from XSD to Ecore.</li>

<li>The infinite loop caused by a missing resource for the
org.eclipse.emf.common plugin has been fixed. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37193">37193</a>).</li>

<li>The generated model editor wizard now provides an encoding
choice. <b>Important!</b> Because of this change, a newly generated
editor plugin will now require (and include) the following import
in its plugin.xml file: 

<p>&lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi"/&gt;</p>

<p>However, because the plugin.xml file is not regenerated or
merged, clients who are regenerating an editor that they have
generated before will need either to remove the plugin.xml file and
let it be regenerated anew, or to add this import manually to the
existing plugin.xml file. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37366">37366</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>The .properties file used by the generated editor plugin is now
ISO-8859-1 encoded. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37367">37367</a>).</li>

<li>The getPropertyDescriptor(Object object, Object propertyId)
method in the
org.eclipse.emf.edit.provider.ItemProviderAdapter.java now demand
creates properties. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37190">37190</a>).</li>

<li>OPTION_ENCODING is now supported an an alternative/override to
setEncoding() when saving an XMLResource
(org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.XMLResource). An example of its use is
as follows: 

<pre>
    Map options = new HashMap();
    options.put(XMLResource.OPTION_ENCODING, initialObjectCreationPage.getEncoding());
    resource.save(options);
</pre>
</li>

<li>Some minor API changes include removing the empty XMIHelper
interface, eliminating XMLResource.changed in favor of supporting
repeating calls to XMLResource.setID, and changing
EObject.eContainmentFeature's result type from EStructuralFeature
to EReference.</li>

<li>Notification.CREATE in
org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Notification.java has been
deprecated. We ask that clients remove uses of Notification.CREATE
so that we can remove it from a subsequent drop. In general, any
deprecation warning should be eliminated in anticipation of the

<p>There are numerous bug fixes and improvements included with this

&#160;</p>

<ul>
<li>The following now applies to the xsd2ecore mapping: 

<ul>
<li>If an attribute's type is primitive (or it is an enum), it
should be unsettable when mapped to Ecore.</li>

<li>If its type is not primitive (and not an enum) and it has a
default value different from null, it should be unsettable when
mapped to Ecore.</li>

<li>Also, support for promoting a primitive type to a wrapper type
for nillable elements has been added.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The eSettingDelegate() accessor method in the EObjectImpl.java
class has been added to provide access to SettingDelegate.</li>

<li>For the EMF .ecore/.genmodel editors and the generated model
editors, the menubar Edit menu items are now enabled when the
outline and properties views have focus.</li>

<li>Multiline @model annotations are now supported.</li>

<li>A check has been added to ensure that the GenPackage's prefix
is always made to begin with an uppercase letter, if it does not
already.</li>

<li>Both IntegerCellEditor and FloatCellEditor have been deprecated
in org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.provider.PropertyDescriptor.java;
EDataTypeCellEditor should be used instead. We ask that clients
remove uses of both IntegerCellEditor and FloatCellEditor so that
we can remove them from a subsequent drop. In general, any
deprecation warning should be eliminated in anticipation of the
support disappearing.</li>

<li>In the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jet package, two constructors
have been added to the JETEmitter.java class to enable the class
loader to be provided explicitly. Also, the GenModelImpl.java class
in the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.genmodel.impl package has been
changed to use them.</li>

<li>When using Java annotations, the following will be
ignored:<br />
<br />
 -an interface that appears in the @extends or @implements notation
in the comment (i.e., an interface that is being extended or
implemented)<br />
<br />
The reasoning for this is as follows: If you want to model this,
you would not use @extends (or @implements, as appropriate).
Therefore, the appearance of an interface in the
@extends/@implements implies that it is intentionally outside of
the model.</li>

Incompatibility</a></b> 

<p>EMF 1.0.1 uses classpath variables in the java projects it
creates. The generator also updates the classpath during generation
(although this feature can be turned off via a genmodel property).
The gist of this is that there can be conflicts with the bare jar
classpath entries used in 1.0.0 projects and therefore, you need to
delete old 1.0.0 classpath entries and then regenerate to create
them correctly. Also, although plugin.property's merge correctly
now (see below), plugin.xml's do not. Because of this, you should
delete old 1.0.0 plugin.xml's and regenerate them for 1.0.1. We
also recommend deleting 1.0.0 genmodels, and recreating them in
1.0.1, because they now support proper reload with persistent
genmodel settings, while the 1.0.0 versions do not.<br />

<p>There is now a documentation plugin, org.eclipse.emf.doc,

available from the desktop Help menu. We've put the documentation
plugin into the Runtime zip file, so its download size has
increased by more than 2M. We're thinking about moving it into the

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_3" name="emf_101b_3">Bug Fixes</a></b><br />
&#160; 

<ul>
<li>Importing a Rose model with nested packages, where the parent
package(s) have no classes in them, caused the generator to ignore
(not generate) all of the classes in the nested package(s).</li>

<li>If you imported annotated Java classes that were in the default
Java package (i.e., no explicit package), the importer crashed and
produced an empty editor window. Now it produces an error message
instead.</li>

<li>Java @model annotations no longer need to be on a line by
themselves in the comment. The importer will recognize @model
followed by 0 or more name=value pairs, anywhere in the comment.
This fixes a problem several people were having with the tutorial,
whereby the import from annotation wasn't finding any classes
because of the formatting of the comments.</li>

<li>Other minor bug fixes. Details available upon request.<br />
&#160;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_4" name="emf_101b_4">Generator
Enhancements</a></b><br />
&#160; 

<ul>
<li>The Ecore Model Project wizard now lets you create a genmodel
from an Ecore XMI file. In 1.0.0 it was only possible to create a
genmodel from a Rose model or annotated Java files.</li>

<li>You can now reload a genmodel from any source, not just from
Rose. The "Reload from Rose" menu item is now just
"Reload...".</li>

<li>Added the ability to control whether you want the edit and
editor code to be generated into their own plugin/project or not.
In 1.0.0, you had no choice but to generate the edit and editor
components into separate plugins.</li>

<li>Added more flexibility in the EMF.Edit generation. You can now
choose (by setting properties in the genmodel editor) which classes
to generate item providers for. In 1.0.0, you were forced to have
one for every class. Also, which features should be properties and
which should generate notification, is now user controllable.</li>

<li>The generator now merges plugin.properties as well as Java
files. In 1.0.0, if you regenerated an edit or editor plugin, it
would not change or overwrite an existing plugin.properties file.
If the model had new properties, you needed to manually add them,
or delete the old plugin.properties file before regenerating.
Plugin.xml's still need to be deleted if you want to regenerate
them.<br />
&#160;</li>
</ul>

<li><b><a id="emf_101b_5" name="emf_101b_5">Added a basic
EMF-generated Ecore model editor</a></b> 

<p>You can use it, instead of the text editor, to view or edit
".ecore" model files. Of course, once we have nice graphical Ecore
editors, this won't be nearly as interesting.</p>
</li>


<li><b><a id="emf_101b_6" name="emf_101b_6">Technology Preview -
Import model from XML Schema</a></b> 

<p>In EMF 1.0.1 you can import your ecore model from an XML Schema,
in addition to Rose or annotated Java. To enable this support, you
need to download and install the <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/xsd">XML Schema Project</a> plugins
first. Here is <a target="_code"
href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/indextools.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.emf/doc/org.eclipse.emf.doc/tutorials/xlibmod/library.xsd">library.xsd</a>,
the Library model expressed in XML Schema. To use it, run the Ecore
Model Project wizard and choose "Load from XML Schema" when
prompted. This is documented in this <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf/docs/?doc=tutorials/xlibmod/xlibmod.html">tutorial</a>. Give
it a try.</p>

<p>One very important difference (advantage) to using XML Schema to
define the model is that, in addition to the default XMI, instances
of the model will (not currently, but in the coming weeks) be
serializable according to the Schema.</p>

<p>Another interesting observation is that the "Book.author" and
"Writer.books" reference types, and the fact that they are opposite
ends of a bidirectional association, are not expressed in the XML
Schema. Consequently, the generator will simply treat them as two
independent one-way references of type EObject. We're looking into
ways of annotating the schema (similar to the Java annotation
approach) with the missing information. If you have any ideas or
suggestions, please feel free to post them to the emf
newsgroup.</p>

<p>Note: This support is very preliminary and highly subject to
change. It is meant to demonstrate the concepts and works well only
with simple schemas.</p>
</li>


<li><b><a id="emf_101b_7" name="emf_101b_7">Proposal to add
annotations to Ecore model objects</a></b> 

<p>Class EAnnotation has been added to the Ecore model as a
proposed design for supporting annotations which follows closely
the design of the XML Schema model's XSDAnnotation. The current
design uses a &lt;&lt;0..*&gt;&gt; details : String, which we
recognize is unacceptably limiting and plan to change it, probably
to a Map, once we've worked out the details of serialization
support for a Map. We would like to solicit feedback on the
EAnnotation design. It will definitely change before the design is
committed to a Release Build. For example, adding a black diamond
relation from EAnnotation to EObject would make it essentially
identical in function to XSDAnnotation; it would mean that no one
would ever have to extend EAnnotation in order to add annotations
and it would ensure that the arbitrary EObjects are well separated
and have a well managed lifetime relative to that which they
annotate.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Generated code is now formatted according to the project (Java
Code Formatter) preferences.</li>

<li>EMF.Edit (e.g., item providers) can now be used in stand-alone
applications (see FAQ for details).</li>

<li>More XML Schema Technology preview. Along with the Java
classes, an XML Schema can now be generated for an Ecore model.
This is the opposite of the import from Schema support (described
above).</li>

<li>EAnnotation design (described above) has been completed.</li>

<li>Added support for map (i.e., EMap) type attributes. See
EAnnotation (attribute "details") for an example.</li>

<li>Some XMI and XML Resource implementation restructuring.</li>

<li>Added simple logging support. There is now a log() method
callable on generated Plugin classes.</li>

            <li>
             Complex type serialization now avoids the potential for introducing a redundant QName prefix.
            </li>

            <li>
             The xsd2ecore mapping has been changed to map an XSD ID-type attribute as an ID EAttribute. 
            </li>

            <li>
             The xsd2ecore mapping has been updated to handle abstract elements and substitution groups.
            </li>

            <li>
             XSD has been updated to recognize schema constraints referenced via include.

            The getEClassifier(XSDTypeDefinition xsdTypeDefinition, boolean supportNull) method in the org.eclipse.xsd.ecore.XSDEcoreBuilder.java class has been updated to ensure that an XSD abstract complex type becomes an abstract EClass.
            </li>

            <li>
            The doSave(OutputStream os, Map options) method in the org.eclipse.xsd.util.XSDResourceImpl.java class has been updated so that if the schema element is null, the updateElement() method is called on the schema.
            </li>

            <li>
            &lt;package prefix=...&gt; elements have been addded to the plugin.xml files for all the EMF and XSD plugins.

            The getBadTypeDerivation(XSDTypeDefinition xsdTypeDefinition, boolean extension, boolean restriction) method in the org.eclipse.xsd.impl.XSDSimpleTypeDefintionImpl.java class has been updated because a simple type needs to be considered to be derived from complex anyType.
            </li>

            The javadoc in the org.eclipse.xsd.XSDComplexTypeDefinition.java file has been updated for the XSDParticle getSyntheticParticle() method.

          <p>
            A schema can be validated to determine whether it is a fully valid instance according to the 1.0 specification;
            since this had been working for several months, it isn't really all that new.

          <b>Documentation Plugin</b>
          <p>
            There is now a documentation plugin, org.eclipse.xsd.doc,
            included in the download. All the XSD documentation is now
            available from the desktop Help menu. We've put the documentation
            plugin into the Runtime zip file, so its download size has increased.
            We're thinking about moving it into the Source zip,
            or maybe into its own zip file, in the future. If you have an
            opinion, please feel free to post it to the XSD newsgroup.
