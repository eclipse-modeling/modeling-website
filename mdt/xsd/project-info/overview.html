<p>The XML Schema Infoset Model is a reference library that provides an 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/javadoc/?project=xsd&page=org/eclipse/xsd/package-summary.html&anchor=details">API</a> for use with any code that
examines, creates or modifies <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLSchema-0">W3C XML Schema</a> (standalone or as part of
other artifacts, such as XForms or WSDL documents).</p>

<p>XSD is a library that provides an 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/javadoc/?project=xsd&page=org/eclipse/xsd/package-summary.html&anchor=details">API</a>
for manipulating the components of an XML
Schema as described by 
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLSchema-0">W3C XML Schema</a>
specifications, as well as an API for
manipulating the DOM-accessible representation of XML Schema as a series
of XML documents, and for keeping these representations in agreement as
schemas are modified.</p>
<p>The library will include services to serialize
and deserialize XML Schema documents, and to do integrity checking of
schemas (for example, not using a maximum value for a simpleType which
is invalid considering the base type of that simpleType). The project
goal is to support 100% of the functionality of XML schema
representation, but not necessarily to provide document against schema
assessment or validation services, which are normally provided by a
validating parser,
such as Apache's <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces-J</a>.</p>
