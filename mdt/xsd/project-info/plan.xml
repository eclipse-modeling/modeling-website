This document lays out the feature and API set for the
2.6.0 release of the Model Development Tools XML Schema Definition (MDT XSD) project.
This project plan inherits from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=modeling.mdt">Modeling Development Tools Project Plan</a>,
which should be referenced when consulting this individual project plan.

      <preamble>
         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Release milestones occur at roughly 6 week intervals 
and follow the Platform release milestone by the Helios-established +1 delta interval,
though all effort will be made to reduce this to +1 business day
regardless of the size of the established +1 delta interval..
The final MDT XSD 2.6 release will available simultaneously 
with the 3.6 release of the Platform and all the other Helios projects.
It is anticipated that MDT XSD will synchronize its milestones 
with any changes to the Helios milestone schedule.

XSD MDT will produce maintenance releases to align with the Ganymede Service Releases
which includes the Eclipse Platform's 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 releases.
XSD MDT may produce additional interim maintenance releases.  
Maintenance releases will only be published if they contain new fixes.
          <ul>
            <li>
Friday, September 26, 2008 - MDT XSD 2.5.1 maintenance release for Ganymede Service Release 1.

            </li>
            <li>
Version numbers are subject to change should there be be any additional maintenance releases.
A list of the issues addressed for the 2.5.x maintenance stream 
are available in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/news/relnotes.php?project=xsd&amp;version=2.5.x">2.5.x release notes</a>.

    <target_environments>
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
In order to remain current, 
each Eclipse release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments. 
The MDT XSD depends upon on the Platform, 
which is mostly "pure" Javaâ„¢. 
The 3.6 release of the Eclipse Platform Project 
is written and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java Platform APIs, 
and targeted to run on version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. 
MDT XSD,
with its runtime support for generics,
relies on Java 5. 
Eclipse Platform SDK 3.6 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. 
MDT XSD will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform.
Given that there is no operating system dependent code in MDT XSD,
it's expected that MDT XSD will work anywhere the Eclipse Platform does.
     </div>
     <internationalization>
          <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, 
including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. 
The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles. 
Similarly, the MDT XSD project will externalize all its user interface elements,
provide English strings for them in its default bundles, 
and localize a subset of the locales offered by the Platform. 
The download page will provide the details as the become available.

Compatibility of Release 2.6: 
The XSD MDT project will be developed in parallel, 
and released simultaneously, 
with the following projects: 
         <ul>
           <li>
Eclipse Platform SDK version 3.6
Eclipse Modeling Framework Core SDK version 2.6
           </li>
        </ul>
Each milestone version of the MDT XSD project 
will be compatible with the corresponding milestone for these projects 
and will be delivered within the appropriate time offset.
The ultimate MDT XSD release will be compatible with the released version of its dependencies
and will publish binary and source compatibilities with migration guides on subsequent releases.

The MDT XSD project has a proven track record of quality and reliability.
Because service and support has and always will take priority over new development work,
development commitments and schedules are subject to arbitrary change, slippage, or even deferral.
Be sure to establish direct communication to ensure that any hard commitments 
are seen as that by the development team itself!
We expect little o4 no development work for the coming release.
