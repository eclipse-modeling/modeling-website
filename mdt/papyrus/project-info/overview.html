is a graphical editing tool that provides UML2 editors and
environment to create and combine any graphical editor
(domain-specific modeling language) defined from Ecore metamodel or
from UML2 profile</FONT>. It is Eclipse-based and it uses the Eclipse
Graphical Modeling Framework.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Papyrus
is a tool consisting of several editors, mainly graphical editors but
also completed with other editors such as textual-based and
tree-based editors. All these editors allow simultaneous viewing of
multiple diagrams of a given model. This model can be UML, UML
profile or any EMF model and it can reference other models (from any
EMF-based modeling language). Papyrus provides a main editor, showing
one or several model diagrams that can be arranged in  tabbed views,
and additional views including an model explorer view, a property
view, and a bird's-eye view. The multiple diagrams are managed by
Papyrus rather than by Eclipse. The tabbed views can be arranged side
by side (left, right, top and bottom), can be created, re-sized,
moved, and deleted by dragging them to the desired position.</FONT></FONT></P>

is highly customizable and allows adding new diagram types developed
using any Eclipse-compatible technology (e.g., GEF, GMF, EMF Tree
Editors). This is achieved through a diagram plug-in mechanism. In
fact, even the default diagrams use this mechanism, allowing their
easy replacement if desired. For each editor, there are generic
preferences that allow customizing the general appearance of all
language concepts. Those preferences are extended to provide specific
options for each language concerning the modeling effort.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
accordance with its primary goal of realizing the UML2 specification,
Papyrus delivers all UML diagram editors  and provides extensive
support for UML profiles. It includes all the facilities for defining
and applying UML profiles in a very rich and efficient manner. It 
provides the same powerful tool customization capabilities for both
profile-based editors and DSML-like (Domain Specific Modeling
Language) editors.. The main difference here is to enable the profile
plug-in of Papyrus to dynamically drive its customization as defined
by a profile. This means that when applying a profile, the tool may
adapt its visual rendering and GUI to fit the specific domain
supported by that profile. Of course, if the profile is unapplied
later, the tool resumes to its previous configuration.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
designing a UML2 profile, it may be necessary to customize  one or
more existing UML2 diagram editors. For that purpose, Papyrus
supports customization of  existing editors with the added capability
of extending such customizations by adding new tools relevant to the
stereotypes defined in the UML profile. For example, the SysML
requirements diagram editor is designed as a customization of the
classical UML2 class diagram editor with additional features for
direct  manipulation of all the concepts defined in the SysML
requirements diagram.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally,
when embedding a profile within an Eclipse plug-in, a designer can
also provide a specific properties view that will simplify (i.e.,
make more user friendly) the manipulation of the stereotypes and
their related properties. The outline editor and the menu of the
tools can also be customized to fit domain-specific concerns
appropriate to the profile.</FONT></FONT></P>
