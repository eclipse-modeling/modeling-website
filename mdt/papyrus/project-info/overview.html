<p>
Papyrus is an open source component of the Model Development Tools (MDT) subproject to provide an integrated, user-consumable environment for editing models based on UML and other related languages such as SysML.
</p>
<p>
Specially, this project will provide the glue around valuable UML and SysML diagram editors (GMF-based or not) and other MDE tools. It will also offer support for UML and SysML profiling mechanisms.
