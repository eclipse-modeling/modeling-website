<html:p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the first release of the Eclipse Papyrus (MDT Papyrus) Project, version 0.0.7</html:p>
<html:p>
<html:i>
A transformation aimed to help users to migrate from Papyrus version 1 and from TopCASED-UML towards MDT Papyrus will be provided early 2010.

   <release_deliverables>
     <html:div>
The release deliverables for each of the MDT OCL releases (1.4 and 3.0) have the same form as 
is found in most Eclipse projects, namely:
<html:ul>
<html:li>MDT Papyrus SDK (includes runtime, sources, examples, and documentation) (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>MDT Papyrus runtime binary distribution (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>MDT Papyrus stand-alone binary distribution (downloadable).</html:li>
<html:li>MDT Papyrus tests (downloadable)</html:li>
<html:li>MDT Papyrus examples (downloadable)</html:li>
</html:ul>
     </html:div>
   </release_deliverables>
   <release_milestones>
      <preamble>
         <html:div>
Release milestones occurring at roughly 6 week intervals and follow the
Platform milestone releases by approximately 1 week; that is, until the
final 3.6 release of the Platform, upon which MDT Papyrus and other projects
will release simultaneously. As MDT Papyrus is a dependency of numerous
other projects, MDT Papyrus will deliver its milestones within one week of
the Eclipse Platform. It is anticipated that MDT Papyrus will synchronize its
milestones with the Galileo milestone schedule. MDT Papyrus 0.0.7 will
be following the same schedule below.

   <target_environments>
     <html:div>
        In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably
        current versions of the underlying operating environments. The Eclipse
        Papyrus (Papyrus OCL) project depends upon on the
        Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java. The 3.6
        release of the Eclipse Platform Project is written and compiled
        against version 5.0 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted to run on
        version 5.0 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. MDT Papyrus
        will target the same Java version as EMF and UML2, which currently require
        Java 5. Eclipse Platform SDK 3.6 will be tested and validated on a
        number of reference platforms. MDT Papyrus will be tested and validated
        against a subset of those listed for the platform.
     </html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis
for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided
by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default
resource bundles. As a result, the MDT Papyrus
project will provide English strings in its default bundles and be
localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Platform. This
plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and
the time frame for availability.
          </html:div>
     </internationalization>
   </target_environments>
   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>
The MDT Papyrus 0.0.7 project
will be developed in parallel, and released simultaneously, with the
following projects. As stated above, each milestone release of the
MDT Papyrus 0.0.7 project will be compatible with the
corresponding milestones for each of these projects, and delivered the
appropriate offset.
<html:ul>
    <html:li>Eclipse Platform SDK version 3.6</html:li>
    <html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) version 2.6</html:li>
    <html:li>Model Development Tools (MDT) UML2 version 3.1</html:li>
    <html:li>Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) version x.y</html:li>
</html:ul>
<html:p>
As described above, the MDT Papyrus 0.0.7 release is not backwards compatible with the Papyrus and TopCASED-UML project.
</html:p>
<html:p>
<html:i>
A transformation aimed to help users to migrate from Papyrus version 1 and from TopCASED-UML towards MDT Papyrus will be provided early 2010.
