<h3>Papyrus</h3>
<div id="introText">

<p class="left">Papyrus is aiming at providing an integrated and user-consumable environment
for editing any kind of EMF model and particularly supporting UML and related modeling languages
 such as SysML and MARTE. Papyrus provides diagram editors for EMF-based modeling languages amongst 
them UML 2 and SysML and the glue required for integrating these editors (GMF-based or not)
with other MBD and MDSD tools.</p>

<p class="right"> Papyrus also offers a very advanced support of UML profiles that
enables users to define editors for DSLs based on the UML 2 standard. The main feature
of Papyrus regarding this latter point is a set of very powerful customization 
mechanisms which can be leveraged to create user-defined Papyrus perspectives and give 
it the same look and feel as a "pure" DSL editor.

<h4>UML2</h4>
<p>Papyrus is graphical editing tool for <a href="http://www.uml.org/">UML2</a> as defined by <a href="http://www.omg.org/">OMG</a>.</p>

<div id="feature_3">
<h4>SysML</h4>
<p>In order to enable system engineering modeling, OMG has defined the  <a href="http://www.sysml.org/">SysML</a> extension to UML2.
In addition to UML2, Papyrus provides hence a complete support to SysML, including an implementation
of the SysML static profile and the specific graphical editors required for SysML.</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_3">
<h4>Textual Editors in Papyrus</h4>
<p>Because text is some time better than graphics for editing some parts of model, Papyrus enables 
to embed contextual text editors enabling syntax highlight, completion and content assist. When a 
text-based model element is accessed, e.g., a property, Papyrus helps by providing a list of possibl
e values, such as a list of existing types, or existing cardinalities. Papyrus also validates the 
text according to its grammar (if the latter is defined). This functionality is customizable: one can
 provide one`s own implementation (e.g., a specific text editor and validation rules) for specific needs.</p>
