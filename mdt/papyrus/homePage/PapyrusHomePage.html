<h3>Papyrus</h3>
<div id="introText">

<p class="left">Papyrus is aiming at providing an integrated and user-consumable environment
for editing any kind of EMF model and particularly supporting UML and related modeling languages
 such as SysML and MARTE. Papyrus provides diagram editors for EMF-based modeling languages amongst 
them UML 2 and SysML and the glue required for integrating these editors (GMF-based or not)
with other MBD and MDSD tools.</p>

<p class="right"> Papyrus also offers a very advanced support of UML profiles that
enables users to define editors for DSLs based on the UML 2 standard. The main feature
of Papyrus regarding this latter point is a set of very powerful customization 
mechanisms which can be leveraged to create user-defined Papyrus perspectives and give 
it the same look and feel as a "pure" DSL editor.
