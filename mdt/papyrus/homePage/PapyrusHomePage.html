<h3>Papyrus</h3>
<div id="introText">

<p class="left">Papyrus is a component of the Model Development Tools (<a href="/www.eclipse.org/mdt">here</a>) subproject
aiming at providing an integrated, user-consumable environment for editing any kind of
EMF model and particularly supporting UML and related modeling languages such as SysML
and MARTE. Papyrus provides diagram editors for EMF-based modeling languages amongst 
them UML 2 and SysML and the glue required for integrating these editors (GMF-based 
or not) with other MBD and MDSD tools.
.</p>

<p class="right"> It also offers a very advanced support of UML 
profiles that enables users to define editors for DSLs based on the UML 2 standard 
and its extension mechanisms. The main feature of Papyrus regarding this latter point
is a set of very powerful customization mechanisms which can be leveraged to create
user-defined Papyrus perspectives and give it the same look and feel as a native DSL editor.
