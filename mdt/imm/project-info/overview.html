<p>
The objectives of the IMM component are to provide
<ul>
  <li>an open source "reference" implementation of the IMM specification</li>
  <li>an EMF-based foundation on which information management modeling tools can be built</li>
  <li>a basis for integrating and interchanging artifacts between information management modeling tools</li>
  <li>a forum for engaging the community in validation of the IMM specification</li>
  <li>an opportunity for increased collaboration between Eclipse and the OMG</li>
</ul>
