<p>The validation component provides the following capabilities.</p>
<p><ol>
	<li>Constraint Definition  - Provides API for defining constraints for any EMF meta-model (batch and live constraints).</li>
	<li>Customizable model traversal algorithms - Extensibility API to support meta-models that require custom strategies for model traversal.</li>
	<li>Constraint parsing for languages - Provides support for parsing the content of constraint elements defined in specific languages. The validation framework provides support for two languages: Java and OCL.</li>
	<li>Configurable constraint bindings to application contexts - API support to define "client contexts" that describe the objects that need to be validated and to bind them to constraints that need to be enforced on these objects.</li>
	<li>Validation listeners - Support for listening to validation events.</li>
</ol></p>
