   <introduction>
     <html:div>
<html:p>
This document lays out the feature and API set for the
seventh release of the EMF Validation Framework (EMF Validation)
Project, version 1.6.0. This project plan inherits from the Modeling
Project Plan, which should be referenced when consulting this
individual project plan.
</html:p><html:p>
The intent for this release is to drive development by community contributions.
No new features are planned by the project committers, but patches from the
community will be processed as efficiently as possible.

   <release_deliverables>
     <html:div>
The release deliverables have the same form as is found in most Eclipse projects, namely:
<html:ul>
<html:li>EMF Validation source code release, available as versions tagged "R1_6" in the project's CVS repository.</html:li>
<html:li>EMF Validation SDK (includes runtime, sources, examples, and documentation) (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>EMF Validation runtime binary distribution (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>EMF Validation tests (downloadable)</html:li>
</html:ul>
     </html:div>
   </release_deliverables>
   <release_milestones>
      <preamble>
         <html:div>
Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals and follow the
Platform milestone releases by approximately 1 week; that is, until the
final 4.2 release of the Platform, upon which EMF Validation and other projects
will release simultaneously. It is anticipated that EMF Validation will synchronize its
milestones with the Juno milestone schedule.

EMF Validation will produce maintenance releases to align with the Juno SR
releases, that includes the Eclipse Platform 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 releases.
EMF Validation may produce interim maintenance releases in addition to these in
order to satisfy clients requests.  Maintenance releases will only be published
if they have any new fixes to offer.
<html:ul>
  <html:li>Friday, September 24, 2012 (last Friday of September) - EMF Validation 1.6.1 maintenance release (if necessary)</html:li>
  <html:li>Friday, February 25, 2013 (last Friday of February) - EMF Validation 1.6.2 maintenance release (if necessary)</html:li>
  <html:li>A list of issues indicated for the 1.6.x maintenance stream can be found in
      bugzilla, or by using links on maintenance stream build pages.</html:li>
</html:ul> 
      </html:div></postamble>
   </release_milestones>
   <target_environments>
     <html:div>
In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably
current versions of the underlying operating environments. The EMF Validation
project depends upon on the
Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java<html:sup>TM</html:sup>. The 4.2
release of the Eclipse Platform Project is written and compiled
against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted to run on
version 1.5 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. EMF Validation
will target the same Java version as EMF Core, which currently requires
Java 5. Eclipse Platform SDK 4.2 will be tested and validated on a
number of reference platforms. EMF Validation will be tested and validated
against a subset of those listed for the platform.
     </html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis
for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided
by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default
resource bundles. As a result, the EMF Validation
project will provide English strings in its default bundles and be
localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Platform. This
plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and
the time frame for availability.
          </html:div>
     </internationalization>
   </target_environments>
   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>
Compatibility of Release 1.5: The EMF Validation project
will be developed in parallel, and released simultaneously, with the
following projects. As stated above, each milestone release of the
EMF Validation project will be compatible with the
corresponding milestones for each of these projects, and delivered the
appropriate offset.
<html:ul>
    <html:li>Eclipse Platform SDK version 4.2</html:li>
    <html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) version 2.8</html:li>
    <html:li>Eclipse MDT OCL version 3.2</html:li>
    <html:li>Eclipse MDT UML2 version 4.0</html:li>
</html:ul>
Therefore, the EMF Validation initial release will be
compatible with these versions and will publish binary and source
compatibilities with migration guides on subsequent releases.

A list of project requirements and agreed upon
implementation time frames is found in this document. For the
milestones listed in this document, a set of overall themes is used

on for each. These themes are presented below, while the requirements
document and associated Bugzilla entries are left to those wanting
more detailed information on each.

The EMF Validation project remains committed to accepting contributions of new features
from the community at large.  Bugzilla items with patches are encouraged, but
other items may be considered at the committers' discretion, according to their
availability.  No committer-driven content is planned.
