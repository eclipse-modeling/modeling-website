      <p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the
      next feature release of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) project (which includes XSD)
      after 2.2.0, designated releases 3.0.0.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they
      entirely static. To ensure the planning process is
      transparent and open to the entire Eclipse community, plans
      are posted in an embryonic form and then revised from time to
      time throughout the release cycle.</p>

      <p>The first part of the plan deals with the important
      matters of release deliverables, release milestones, target
      operating environments, and release-to-release compatibility.
      These are all things that need to be clear for any release,
      even if no features were to change.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the
      projects under the EMF and XSD projects. Each
      plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added, or
      some aspect that is to be improved. Each plan item has its
      own entry in the 
      <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs">Eclipse bugzilla</a>

      database, with a title and a concise summary (usually a
      single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
      high enough level so that everyone can readily understand
      what the work item is without having to understand the
      nitty-gritty detail.</p>

      <p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some
      may be quite large, others, quite small. Some plan items may
      involve work that is localized to a single subsystem; others
      may involve coordinated changes across several projects
      within the same top-level project; and others may involve
      coordination with other top-level projects. Although some
      plan items are for work that is more pressing that others,
      the plan items appear in no particular order.</p>

      <p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is
      the plan for how we will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs,
      improving test coverage, documentation, examples, performance
      tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine ongoing
      maintenance activities and are not included in this plan
      unless they would also involve a significant change to the
      API or feature set, or involve a significant amount of work.
      The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting
      feature work.</p>

      <h2>
      <a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments">
      </a>

      Target Operating Environments</h2>

      <p>In order to remain current, each release of an Eclipse
      project targets reasonably current versions of underlying
      operating environments and other Eclipse projects on which it
      depends.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Most of Eclipse is "pure" Java 
      <sup>TM</sup>

      code and has no direct dependence on the underlying operating
      system. The chief dependence is on the Eclipse Platform, and
      on the Java 2 Platform that runs it.</p>

      <p>The EMF and XSD 3.0.0 releases depend on the
      following:</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Java 2 Platform 5.0</li>

        <li>Eclipse Platform 3.3.0</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The 3.0.0 releases of EMF and XSD are designed to run
      on any configuration supporting the above components.</p>

      <p>The Eclipse Platform runs in a variety of operating
      environments. Testing is focused on a handful of popular
      combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these
      are our 
      <em>reference platforms</em>.

      Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many operating
      environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However,
      since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for
      them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on
      non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any
      reference platform will be given lower priority than problems
      with running Eclipse on a reference platform.</p>

      <p>See the 
      <!--<a
      href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_3.html">-->
      <i style="color:gray">Eclipse Project 3.3 plan</i> (forthcoming)<!--</a>-->

      for a list of reference platforms.</p>

      <h4>Internationalization</h4>

      <p>Eclipse is designed as the basis for internationalized
      products. The user interface elements provided by the various
      Eclipse projects, including dialogs and error messages, are
      externalized. The English strings for EMF and XSD are
      provided as the default resource bundles. Translations are
      not provided with this release. However, the plug-in fragment
      mechanism provides the means by which translations into any
      number of other languages can be incorporated.</p>

      <h2>
      <a name="Compatibility">
      </a>

      Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>

      <h3>Compatibility of Release 3.0.0 with 2.2.0</h3>

      <p>EMF and XSD 3.0.0 will be compatible with EMF and XSD 2.2.0, except in those areas noted in the 
      <a href="#MigrationGuide">
        <em>EMF and XSD 3.0.0 Migration Guide.</em>
      </a>.</p>

      <p>
      <b>API Contract Compatibility:</b>

      EMF and XSD 3.0.0 will be upwards contract-compatible
      with EMF and XSD 2.2.0 except in those areas noted in the
      
      <a href="#MigrationGuide">
        <em>EMF and XSD 3.0.0 Migration Guide.</em>
      </a>

      Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will
      need to be ported to EMF and XSD 3.0.0 APIs. Downward
      contract compatibility is not supported. There is no
      guarantee that compliance with EMF and XSD 3.0.0 APIs
      would ensure compliance with EMF and XSD 1.x APIs. Refer
      to 
      <em>
        <a
        href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">
        Evolving Java-based APIs</a>
      </em>

      for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain
      contract compatibility.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b>

      EMF and XSD 3.0.0 will be upwards binary-compatible with
      EMF and XSD 2.2.0 except in those areas noted in the 
      <a href="#MigrationGuide">
        <em>EMF and XSD 3.0.0 Migration Guide.</em>
      </a>

      Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported: plug-ins
      compiled against EMF and XSD 3.0.0 will likely be
      unusable with EMF and XSD 1.x. Refer to 
      <em>
        <a
        href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">
        Evolving Java-based APIs</a>
      </em>

      for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain
      binary compatibility.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Source Compatibility:</b>

      Source files written to use EMF and XSD 2.2.0 APIs will
      usually compile and run successfully against EMF and XSD
      3.0.0 APIs, although this cannot be guaranteed. 
      Because EMF 3.0.0 will exploit new Java language constructs, 
      there is an increased chance of source incompatibilities 
      compared to previous EMF releases.
      In some
      cases, it may be necessary to make minor changes to the
      source code to disambiguate things like imports or overloaded
      method invocations. Downward source compatibility is not
      supported. If source files use new APIs, they will not be
      usable with earlier versions.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Workspace Compatibility:</b>

      EMF and XSD 3.0.0 will be upwards
      workspace-compatible with EMF and XSD 2.2.0 unless noted.
      This means that workspaces and projects created by an Eclipse
      with EMF and XSD 2.2.0 installed can be successfully
      opened by an Eclipse with EMF and XSD 3.0.0 installed.
      This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a
      particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within
      a workspace project, which may propagate between workspaces
      via file copying or team repositories. User interface session
      state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. Downward
      workspace compatibility is not supported. Metadata files
      created (or overwritten) by the newer version will generally
      be unusable with older versions.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Non-compliant usage of API's:</b>

      All non-API methods and classes, and certainly everything in
      a package with "internal" in its name, are considered
      implementation details which may vary between operating
      environment and are subject to change without notice. Client
      plug-ins that directly depend on anything other than what is
      specified in the API are inherently unsupportable and receive
      no guarantees about compatibility within a single release
      much less with an earlier releases. Refer to 
      <em>

        href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">
        How to Use the Eclipse API</a>
      </em>

      <a name="MigrationGuide">
      </a>

      EMF and XSD 3.0.0 Migration Guide</h3>

      <p>At this time, there are no known issues migrating from
      2.2.0 to 3.0.0. 
      Should this change, this document will be
      revised, or a secondary document will be added documenting
      any known issues.</p>

      <h2>
      <a name="Themes">
      </a>

      Themes</h2>
  <p><img width="12" height="12" src="/emf/images/green-box.gif"
      border="0" /> The changes under consideration for the next release of
      Eclipse EMF and XSD address a few major themes: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Built To Last</b>
        - EMF and XSD has always been a framework for delivering integrated modeling tools. With a growing base of both free and commercial offerings based on EMF and XSD, it's critical for continued success to maintain API stability, to ensure that the framework scales well, and to keep pace with the Java language. This theme includes work to measure and improve the performance and scalability of EMF and XSD resources.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Simple To Use</b>
        - The EMF and XSD framework needs to not only provide the features that advanced developers demand, but also be something that most developers find simple to use. This theme includes ease-of-use reviews of existing features, and work that helps make EMF and XSD-based products simple to use for developers with widely-varying backgrounds and skill sets. </li>

        <li>
        <b>Release Currency</b>
        - Modeling projects will maintain release currency concurrent with 3.x releases. For EMF and XSD 3.0.0, this means currency with Eclipse 3.3.0 and Java SE 5.0.</li>
		
		<li><b>Modeling Project Integration</b> 
		- Facilitate and participate in integration & re-use of build and release infrastructure and web content across subprojects. Promote development of a community around modeling technologies at Eclipse.
        

</ul>

<p><img width="12" height="12" src="/emf/images/green-box.gif"
      border="0" /> Additionally, the following plan items have been proposed.</p>
<ul>        
        <li><b>Java SE 5.0 Support</b> 
        - exploit new Java language constructs; use generics (e.g. EList, EMap and implementations); generate and merge Java 5 constructs; investigate enumerations and annotations</li>
        <li><b>Ecore Constraints</b>
        - define and validate constraints on user-defined Ecore models</li>
        <li><b>XSD2Ecore Enhancements</b>
 		- improve ability to record complex content models as Ecore annotations</li>
        <li><b>JET Unification</b>
        - adopt JET2 in code generation tools</li>
        <li><b>Build &amp; Web Infrastructure Improvements </b>
        - refresh website to new Phoenix skin, reorganize EMF into features, integrate select EMFT projects into EMF, and continue to improve and automate build and release processes</li> 
        <li><b>Performance</b>
        - continued performance monitoring and enhancement</li>
</ul>


      <p>The current status of each plan item is noted:</p>

      <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <b>Plan Item</b>

        items - a <i>Plan Item</i> that we have
        decided to address for the release. To see all committed items - see <i>"committed"</i> items</li>
        <li>
        <b>Committed</b>

        items - A committed bug is one that we have
        decided to address for the release.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Proposed</b>

        items - A bug item is one that we are
        considering addressing for the release. Although we are
        actively investigating it, we are not yet in a position to
        commit to it, or to say that we won't be able to address
        it. After due consideration, a proposal will either be
        committed or deferred.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Deferred</b>

        items - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
        to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with
        a brief note as to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items
        may resurface as committed plan items at a later
        point.</li>
