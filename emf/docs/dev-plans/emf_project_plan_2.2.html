      <p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the
      next feature release of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) project (which includes XSD and SDO)
      after 2.1.0, designated release 2.2.</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a>

          releases</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="#Project">EMF, SDO and XSD Project</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they
      entirely static. To ensure the planning process is
      transparent and open to the entire Eclipse community, plans
      are posted in an embryonic form and then revised from time to
      time throughout the release cycle.</p>

      <p>The first part of the plan deals with the important
      matters of release deliverables, release milestones, target
      operating environments, and release-to-release compatibility.
      These are all things that need to be clear for any release,
      even if no features were to change.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the
      projects under the EMF, XSD and SDO projects. Each
      plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added, or
      some aspect that is to be improved. Each plan item has its
      own entry in the 
      <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs">Eclipse bugzilla</a>

      database, with a title and a concise summary (usually a
      single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
      high enough level so that everyone can readily understand
      what the work item is without having to understand the
      nitty-gritty detail.</p>

      <p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some
      may be quite large, others, quite small. Some plan items may
      involve work that is localized to a single subsystem; others
      may involve coordinated changes across several projects
      within the same top-level project; and others may involve
      coordination with other top-level projects. Although some
      plan items are for work that is more pressing that others,
      the plan items appear in no particular order.</p>

      <p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is
      the plan for how we will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs,
      improving test coverage, documentation, examples, performance
      tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine ongoing
      maintenance activities and are not included in this plan
      unless they would also involve a significant change to the
      API or feature set, or involve a significant amount of work.
      The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting
      feature work.</p>

      Release milestones</h2>

      <p>EMF, SDO and XSD builds are available weekly as <em>Integration

      <h2>
      <a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments">
      </a>

      Target Operating Environments</h2>

      <p>In order to remain current, each release of an Eclipse
      project targets reasonably current versions of underlying
      operating environments and other Eclipse projects on which it
      depends.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Most of Eclipse is "pure" Java 
      <sup>TM</sup>

      code and has no direct dependence on the underlying operating
      system. The chief dependence is on the Eclipse Platform, and
      on the Java 2 Platform that runs it.</p>

      <p>The EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 releases depend on the
      following:</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Java 2 Platform 1.4</li>

        <li>Eclipse Platform 3.2</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Additionally, if loading or importing models from XML
      Schema, the following is required. 
      <a
      href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/scripts/downloads-xerces.php">
      Click here for an explanation of this additional
      requirement.</a>
      </p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Xerces2-J 2.6.2 or higher</li>

        <li>XML4J</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The 2.2.0 releases of EMF, SDO and XSD are designed to run
      on any configuration supporting the above components.</p>

      <p>The Eclipse Platform runs in a variety of operating
      environments. Testing is focused on a handful of popular
      combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these
      are our 
      <em>reference platforms</em>

      . Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many operating
      environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However,
      since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for
      them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on
      non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any
      reference platform will be given lower priority than problems
      with running Eclipse on a reference platform.</p>

      <p>See the 
      <a
      href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_2.html">
      Eclipse Project 3.2 plan</a>

      for a list of reference platforms.</p>

      <h4>Internationalization</h4>

      <p>Eclipse is designed as the basis for internationalized
      products. The user interface elements provided by the various
      Eclipse projects, including dialogs and error messages, are
      externalized. The English strings for EMF, SDO and XSD are
      provided as the default resource bundles. Translations are
      not provided with this release. However, the plug-in fragment
      mechanism provides the means by which translations into any
      number of other languages can be incorporated.</p>

      <h2>
      <a name="Compatibility">
      </a>

      Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>

      <h3>Compatibility of Release 2.2.0 with 2.1.0</h3>

      <p>EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 will be compatible with
      EMF, SDO and XSD 2.1.0.</p>

      <p>
      <b>API Contract Compatibility:</b>

      EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 will be upwards contract-compatible
      with EMF, SDO and XSD 2.1.0 except in those areas noted in the
      
      <a href="#MigrationGuide">
        <em>EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 Migration Guide.</em>
      </a>

      Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will
      need to be ported to EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 APIs. Downward
      contract compatibility is not supported. There is no
      guarantee that compliance with EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 APIs
      would ensure compliance with EMF, SDO and XSD 1.x APIs. Refer
      to 
      <em>
        <a
        href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">
        Evolving Java-based APIs</a>
      </em>

      for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain
      contract compatibility.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b>

      EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 will be upwards binary-compatible with
      EMF, SDO and XSD 2.1.0 except in those areas noted in the 
      <a href="#MigrationGuide">
        <em>EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 Migration Guide.</em>
      </a>

      Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported: plug-ins
      compiled against EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 will likely be
      unusable with EMF, SDO and XSD 1.x. Refer to 
      <em>
        <a
        href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">
        Evolving Java-based APIs</a>
      </em>

      for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain
      binary compatibility.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Source Compatibility:</b>

      Source files written to use EMF, SDO and XSD 2.1.0 APIs will
      usually compile and run successfully against EMF, SDO and XSD
      2.2.0 APIs, although this cannot be guaranteed. In some
      cases, it may be necessary to make minor changes to the
      source code to disambiguate things like imports or overloaded
      method invocations. Downward source compatibility is not
      supported. If source files use new APIs, they will not be
      usable with earlier versions.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Workspace Compatibility:</b>

      EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 will be upwards
      workspace-compatible with EMF, SDO and XSD 2.1.0 unless noted.
      This means that workspaces and projects created by an Eclipse
      with EMF, SDO and XSD 2.1.0 installed can be successfully
      opened by an Eclipse with EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 installed.
      This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a
      particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within
      a workspace project, which may propagate between workspaces
      via file copying or team repositories. User interface session
      state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. Downward
      workspace compatibility is not supported. Metadata files
      created (or overwritten) by the newer version will generally
      be unusable with older versions.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Non-compliant usage of API's:</b>

      All non-API methods and classes, and certainly everything in
      a package with "internal" in its name, are considered
      implementation details which may vary between operating
      environment and are subject to change without notice. Client
      plug-ins that directly depend on anything other than what is
      specified in the API are inherently unsupportable and receive
      no guarantees about compatibility within a single release
      much less with an earlier releases. Refer to 
      <em>

        href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">

      EMF, SDO and XSD 2.2.0 Migration Guide</h3>

      <p>At this time, there are no known issues migrating from
      2.1.0 to 2.2.0. Should this change, this document will be
      revised, or a secondary document will be added documenting
      any known issues.</p>

      <h2>
      <a name="Themes">
      </a>

      Themes</h2>

      <p>The changes under consideration for the next release of
      Eclipse EMF/SDO and XSD address a few major themes:</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
        <b>Built To Last</b>

        - EMF, SDO and XSD has always been a framework for
        delivering integrated modeling tools. With a growing base
        of both free and commercial offerings based on EMF, SDO and
        XSD, it's critical for continued success to maintain API
        stability and ensure that the framework scales well. This
        theme includes work to measure and improve the performance
        and scalability of EMF, SDO and XSD resources.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Simple To Use</b>

        - The EMF, SDO and XSD framework needs to not only provide
        the features that advanced developers demand, but also be
        something that most developers find simple to use. This
        theme includes ease-of-use reviews of existing features,
        and work that helps make EMF/SDO and XSD-based products
        simple to use for developers with widely-varying
        backgrounds and skill sets.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Release Currency</b>

        - Tools projects will maintain release currency concurrent
        with 3.x releases. For EMF/SDO and XSD 2.2, this means
        currency with Eclipse 3.2.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Enchancing JET</b>

        - Plans are underway to make the JET templates more powereful; for example, 
          to investigate tag libraries in JET.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Java 2 Standard Edition 5 Support</b>

        - This theme is currently deferred to post Eclipse 3.2. </li>
</ul>


      <p>The current status of each plan item is noted:</p>

      <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <b>Plan Item</b>

        items - a <i>Plan Item</i> that we have
        decided to address for the release. To see all committed items - see <i>"committed"</i> items</li>
        <li>
        <b>Committed</b>

        items - A committed bug is one that we have
        decided to address for the release.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Proposed</b>

        items - A bug item is one that we are
        considering addressing for the release. Although we are
        actively investigating it, we are not yet in a position to
        commit to it, or to say that we won't be able to address
        it. After due consideration, a proposal will either be
        committed or deferred.</li>

        <li>
        <b>Deferred</b>

        items - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
        to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with
        a brief note as to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items
        may resurface as committed plan items at a later
        point.</li>
      </ul>
