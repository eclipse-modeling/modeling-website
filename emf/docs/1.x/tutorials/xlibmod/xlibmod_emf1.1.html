<h2>Generating an EMF 1.1 Model using XML Schema</h2>

<p>This tutorial provides a step-by-step description for creating
an EMF model from an XML schema and then generating a simple model
editor for it. Completing this tutorial will enable you to see how
easy EMF makes it to go from a simple model definition in an XML
schema to a fully-functioning editor for that model.</p>

<p>The XML schema file we use in this tutorial can be found here:
<a  target="_code"
href="images/../library.xsd">library.xsd</a>. Save
it somewhere on your workstation for later use.</p>

<p>The mapping rules from XML schema to ECore are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each target namespace of a schema maps to an EPackage.</li>

<li>A complex type definition or a top level element declaration
maps to an EClass.</li>

<li>A simple type definition maps to an EDataType, except for the
types anyURI, QName, IDREF, or IDREFS, which instead map to the
EClass for EObject.</li>

<li>An attribute declaration or a nested element declaration maps
to an EAttribute if its type maps to an EDataType, or to an
EReference if its type maps to an EClass.</li>
</ul>

From a modeling perspective, an XML schema is not as expressive as
ECore. An XML schema cannot be used to define bi-directional
references, nor can it provide the type of a reference target.

version 1.1.0 of EMF and <a

version 1.1.0 of XSD.</a></p>

<h3>Step 0: Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The EMF runtime package includes the EMF generator and a number
of related plugins. And the XML Infoset Model is a reference
library that can examine, create or modify XML Schemas. After
installing the EMF runtime package and <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf/downloads/dl-xsd1x.html">
XML Infoset Model</a>, verify that they are available in your
Eclipse environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring up the "Help/About Eclipse Platform" dialog.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg001.gif"
alt="Help/About Eclipse Platform" height="123" width="168" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Click on "Plug-in Details".<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg002.gif"
alt="Plug-in Details" height="332" width="464" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Check that the highlighted plugins are present.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg003.gif"

&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: right"><a id="step1"
name="step1">&nbsp;</a><a href="#top">contents</a></p>

<h3>Step 1: Importing the Model from XML Schema</h3>

<p>Use the XML Schema file you saved earlier: <a target="_code"
href="images/../library.xsd">library.xsd</a> as a
sample model.</p>

<p>Create a new Ecore model project in the workspace:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring up the "File/New/Project..." dialog.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg101.gif"
alt="File/New/Project..." height="55" width="341" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Eclipse Modeling Framework" and "EMF Project". Click
the "Next" button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg132.gif" alt="EMF Project"
height="150" width="394" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Give the project a name, say, "library". Then, click the "Next"
button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg133.gif"
alt="Name the project" height="203" width="294" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Load from an XML Schema" and click the "Next"
button.<br />
 <img src="images/xl101.gif" alt="Load from an XML Schema"
height="200" width="255" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Click on the "Browse File System..." or "Browse Workspace..."
button to locate and load the XML schema file on your system.
Alternatively, you can enter the XML schema file's location
directly in the "XML Schema URI" entry field and then click on the
"Load..." button to load it. (Note: If you locate the schema using
either "Browse File System..." button or "Brose Workspace..."
button, you do not need to click on the "Load..." button.)<br />
 <img src="images/xl102.gif" alt="Browse for XML Schema file"
height="200" width="500" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>After the XML schema file is loaded, a default GenModel name
will be suggested. You can change the name in the "Generator model
name" entry field if you wish. You can also select "Create XML
Schema to Ecore Map" to generate a mapping file that maps from an
XML Schema to Ecore, with an extension of ".xsd2ecore". If you do
not select this option, the mapping file is not generated. Click
the "Next" button.<br />
 <img src="images/xl103.gif" alt="Gen Model Name" height="500"
width="500" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select the package for which you want to generate an EMF model
- In general, there can be many packages within a single schema.
However, in this case, there is only one package, "library". Click
the "Finish" button.<br />
 <img src="images/xl104.gif" alt="Select package" height="500"
width="500" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Three files will be created: (1) A mapping file that maps from
an XML Schema to Ecore, with an extension of ".xsd2ecore", (2) an
Ecore model, with an extension of ".ecore", and (3) a GenModel,
with an extension of ".genmodel". The GenModel, which controls code
generation for the model appears in the main view.<br />
 <img src="images/xl105.gif" alt="Opened GenModel" height="167"
width="498" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ecore model "com.example.library.ecore" has the package name
as its file name. The package name comes from the value of the
EPackage's nsPrefix attribute is derived from the schema's target
namespace (if the schema has a target namespace), or from the URI
file path of the schema document if the schema does not contain a
target namespace. In this sample, the "library.xsd" file includes a
targetNamespace attribute that has a value of
"http://www.example.com/library". Therefore, the nsPrefix attribute
for the "Library" is set to "com.example.library".</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><a id="step2"
name="step2">&nbsp;</a><a href="#top">contents</a></p>

<h3>Step 2: Generating the EMF Model Code</h3>

<p>The GenModel shows a root node, representing the whole model.
The model object has children that represent its packages, whose
children then represent classifiers (classes and datatypes,
including enumerated types). The children of classes are class
attributes, references, and operations; the children of enumerated
types are enum literals.</p>

<ul>
<li>The GenModel can be expanded to see its various elements.<br />
 <img src="images/xl201.gif" alt="Expanded GenModel" height="200"
width="320" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>There are properties associated with each node. If the
Properties view isn't already showing, bring up "Window/Show
View/Other..."<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg202.gif"
alt="Window/Show View/Other..." height="257" width="378" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Expand the "Basic" set of views and choose "Properties".<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg203.gif"
alt="Chose Properties" height="164" width="153" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>These properties control the behavior of the code
generator.<br />
 <img src="images/xl202.gif" alt="GenModel properties" height="523"
width="518" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases, the values of the properities need not be changed
from their default values, but these options can provide a great
deal of control over the code that gets generated. This topic will
be explored more fully in future tutorial material; for now, select
several different GenModel objects, and observe their
properties.</p>

<p>The GenModel is also the place where you initiate the code
generation. By right-clicking on an object in the model, you can
generate code for it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Right-click the "library" model object and select "Generate
Model Code" from the pop-up menu.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg207.gif"
alt="Generate Model" height="238" width="213" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Observe the generated files.<br />
 <img src="images/xl203.gif" alt="Generated model code"
height="340" width="246" /><br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>

<p>After generation, the class interfaces and enum class will have
been created, and a new pair of interfaces will have been created
for the package itself and for the factory. There will also be two
new packages, with "impl" and "util" suffixes, which contain
implementations of the interfaces and additional utility classes,
and a "plugin.xml" manifest file for the model plugin.</p>

<p>If you change the XML schema file, you can regenerate the model
code from it, and the corresponding changes in the model code will
be merged with any hand modifications that may have been made to
the code that was generated previously. You can also selectively
generate a subset of the model code by right-clicking on a package,
class, or enum object and selecting "Generate Model Code" from the
pop-up menu.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><a id="step3"
name="step3">&nbsp;</a><a href="#top">contents</a></p>

<h3>Step 3: Generating an Editor for the Model</h3>

<p>A fully-functional Eclipse editor can also be generated for any
model. By default, it is split between two plugins: (1) an "edit"
plugin, which includes adapters that provide a structured view and
perform command-based editing of the model objects, and (2) an
"editor" plugin, which provides the UI for the editor and a
wizard.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the GenModel, right-click the "Library" model object and
select "Generate Edit Code" from the pop-up menu.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg301.gif"
alt="Generate Edit Code" height="240" width="220" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Right-click the model object and select "Generate Editor Code"
from the pop-up menu.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg304.gif"
alt="Generate Editor Code" height="233" width="212" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Observe the generated projects, with "edit" and "editor"
suffixes.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg302.gif"
alt="Edit and editor projects" height="37" width="118" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, if you wish to generate the model, edit, and editor
plugins in a single step, you can do so by selecting "Generate All"
from the pop-up menu.</p>

<p>The code should be compiled automatically as it is generated,
and should recompile whenever it is changed. If you have disabled
automatic building in the workbench preferences, you can initiate
compilation manually:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select "Rebuild All" from the "Project" menu.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg303.gif"
alt="Project/Rebuild All" height="110" width="377" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>There should no errors in the "library", "library.edit", and
"library.editor" projects.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg305.gif" alt="No errors"
height="72" width="247" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right"><a id="step4"
name="step4">&nbsp;</a><a href="#top">contents</a></p>

<h3>Step 4: Running the Generated Editor</h3>

<p>In order to run plugins in a runtime workbench, a lunch
configuration must first be set up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select "Run..." from the "Run" menu.<br />
 <img src="images/xl401.gif" alt="Run/Run..." height="155"
width="493" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Run-time Workbench" and click the "New" button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg402.gif"
alt="New Run-time Workbench" height="329" width="615" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>You may want to change the configuration's name to something
more recognizable. Then, switch to the "Plug-ins and Fragments"
tab.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg403.gif"
alt="Name the configuration" height="245" width="575" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Choose plugin-ins and fragments to launch from the
list", and then select the top-level "External Plug-ins".<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg404.gif"
alt="Select all External Plugins" height="297" width="457" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Switch to the "Common" tab, select "Run" from the "Display in
favorites menu" section of the dialog, and the click the "Apply"
button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg405.gif"
alt="Display in favorites menu: Run" height="363"
width="470" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>A runtime workbench can be launched from the "Launch
Configurations" dialog by clicking on the "Run" button. Once the
launch configuration has been set up, it can also be launched from
the "Run" button on the toolbar.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the new launch configuration from the "Run" button
drop-down.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg406.gif"
alt="Library Configuration" height="124" width="355" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Wait for a second instance of the Eclipse platform to come up.
Bring up the "Help/About Eclipse Platform" dialog, click on the
"Plug-in Details" button, and verify that the generated plugins are
there.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg407.gif"
alt="Plug-in Details" height="437" width="595" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The library model wizard can now be used to create a new
instance of the model.</p>

<ul>
<li>Working in the Resource perspective, Bring up the
"File/New/Project..." dialog.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg101.gif"
alt="File/New/Project..." height="55" width="341" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Simple" and "Project". Click the "Next" button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg408.gif"
alt="Simple Project" height="91" width="333" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Give the project a name and click the "Finish" button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg409.gif"
alt="Name the project" height="126" width="213" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Right-click the project and select "New/Other..." from the
pop-up menu.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg410.gif"
alt="New/Other..." height="178" width="387" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Example EMF Model Creation Wizards" and "Library
Model". Click the "Next" button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg411.gif"
alt="Library Model" height="500" width="500" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Enter a file name for the library model. Make sure it ends with
a ".library" extension. Then click the "Next" button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg412.gif"
alt="Name the library model file" height="46" width="146" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Select "Library" as the model object, and click the "Finish"
button.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg413.gif"
alt="Select the Model Object" height="238" width="498" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The newly created library model is opened in the main
view.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg414.gif"
alt="New library model" height="118" width="482" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The root object in this editor corresponds to the "My.library"
resource. Under it lies a single library, the object that was
selected as the model object in the wizard.</p>

<ul>
<li>Expand the "platform:/resource/librarytest/My.library" resource
to see the library object. Select it.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg415.gif"
alt="Expanded resource" height="242" width="592" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>In the Properties view, click on the "Value" column of the
"Name" property, and give a name to the library. The label in the
main view will be updated when you hit Enter.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg416.gif"
alt="Name the library" height="105" width="646" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Right-click on the library and select "New Child/Writer" from
the pop-up menu to add a new writer to the library.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg417.gif"
alt="New Child/Writer" height="240" width="332" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Enter the name of the writer in the Properties view.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg418.gif"
alt="Name the writer" height="260" width="470" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Similarly, a book can be added to the library.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg419.gif"
alt="New Child/Book" height="238" width="325" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>All the book's attributes and references can be edited in the
Properties view.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg420.gif"
alt="Book properties" height="365" width="568" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>You can save, close, and then re-open the model using the text
editor if you wish to see the saved model in XMI format.<br />
 <img src="images/../../clibmod/images/cg421.gif"
alt="Open With/Text Editor" height="213" width="379" /><br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The XMI format file of "My.library" contains a Library object
called "Skills Center", a Book object with the value of title as
"Fellowinship of the Ring", and a Writer object that "JRR Tolkien"
is the writer's name.<br />
