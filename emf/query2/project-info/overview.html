<p>The Query2 component facilitates the process of search and retrieval of emf model elements in a structured format with an additional advantage that resource loading is minimized during execution.</p>
<p>Query2 uses an in-built index mechanism to speed up the queries.
The indexes are build before query execution and used during query execution. The indexes can be re-used by multiple query executions.
For majority of queries, the resources are not needed to be loaded, and hence it provide incredible improvements in terms of memory consumption.
</p>
<p> Query2 supports multiple ways to specify queries. 
<ol>
<li>User can use APIs for the basic EObject based Condition objects that are used to formulate queries for EMF models.</li>
<li>User can specify queries in SQL like syntax. e.g from Manuscript as a select a.pages where a.title = "Learning Query2"</li>
</ol>
