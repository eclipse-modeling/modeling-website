	<p>CDO is both a technology for distributed shared EMF models and a fast server-based 
	O/R mapping solution. With CDO you can easily enhance your existing models in such a way that 
	saving a resource transparently commits the applied changes to a relational database. Optionally 
	other connected clients are actively notified about these changes so that their model copies get 
	partially invalidated and all user interfaces reflect the current state at once. Stored resources 
	are demand-loaded from the database only as needed. CDO uses the Net4j technology as a flexible 
	and scalable signalling backbone.</p>
