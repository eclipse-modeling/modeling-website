<p>
	The CDO (Connected Data Objects) Model Repository is a distributed shared model framework for EMF models and meta models.
	CDO is also a model runtime environment with a focus on orthogonal aspects like model scalability, transactionality,
	persistence, distribution, queries and more.<br>

	CDO has a 3-tier architecture supporting EMF-based client applications, featuring a central model repository server
	and leveraging different types of pluggable data storage back-ends like relational databases,
	object databases and file systems. The default client/server communication protocol is
	implemented with the Net4j Signalling Platform.
