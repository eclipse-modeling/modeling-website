    EMF's primary development focus is on its 2.2 release, which is currently expected in June or July, 2005.  Themes and plan items for this release can be found in the project plan document.  We have opted not to exploit the capabilities of Java 5.0 in this release, as the requirement from our users to provide a 1.4-compatible runtime is currently much stronger than the desire for 5.0 features, and we only have the resources to support active development in one runtime.
    EMF is also looking to provide leadership and support for the new EMF Technology (EMFT) project.  Contributions are currently being offered relating to database persistence, transformation, query, validation, and more.  We are looking forward to helping these contributions to mature, and eventually incorporating some into EMF.
    Maintenance is also being provided for the 2.0 and 2.1 streams.
