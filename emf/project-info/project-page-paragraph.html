<p><b><a href="/emf/">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</a></b>
The EMF project is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building 
tools and other applications based on a structured data model. From a model 
specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to 
produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set of adapter 
classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model, and 
a basic editor.</p>
<p>
EMF includes the XML Schema Infoset Model (XSD) project and an EMF-based 
implementation of Service Data Objects (SDO). XSD provides a model and API 
for manipulating components of an XML Schema, with access to the underlying 
DOM representation of the schema document. SDO is a framework that simplifies 
and unifies data application development in a service-oriented architecture 
(SOA). It supports and integrates XML and incorporates J2EE patterns and 
best practices.
