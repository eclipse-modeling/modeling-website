<p>
The EMF project is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building 
tools and other applications based on a structured data model. From a model 
specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to 
produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set of adapter 
classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model, and 
a basic editor.</p>

EMF builds include 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=xsd#xsd">XML Schema Infoset Model</a> (XSD), 
now a component of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=xsd">Model Development Tools</a> (MDT) project, 
and an EMF-based implementation of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/?project=sdo">Service Data Objects</a> (SDO). 
Other subprojects are packaged separately. 
XSD provides a model and API 
for manipulating components of an XML Schema, with access to the underlying 
DOM representation of the schema document.
