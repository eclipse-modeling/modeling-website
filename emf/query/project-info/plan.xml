	<introduction>
		<html:div>
			<html:p>
				This document lays out the feature and API set for the fifth
				release of
				the EMF Model Query (EMF Query) Project, version 1.5.0.
				This project
				plan inherits from the Modeling Project Plan, which
				should be
				referenced when consulting this individual project plan.
			</html:p>
			<html:p>
				The intent for this release is to drive development by
				community contributions. No new features are planned by the project
				committers, but patches from the community will be processed as
				efficiently as possible.

				Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals and
				follow the Platform milestone releases by approximately 1 week; that
				is, until the final 3.7 release of the Platform, upon which EMF
				Query and other projects will release simultaneously. It is
				anticipated that EMF Query will synchronize its milestones with the
				Galileo milestone schedule

				EMF Query will produce maintenance releases to align with the Indigo
				SR releases, that includes the Eclipse Platform 3.7.1 and 3.7.2
				releases. EMF Query may produce interim maintenance releases in
				addition to these in order to satisfy clientâ€™s requests. Maintenance
				releases will only be published if they have any new fixes to offer
				<html:ul>
					<html:li>Friday, September 30, 2011 (last Friday of September) -
						EMF Query 1.4.1 maintenance release (if necessary)</html:li>
					<html:li>Friday, February 24, 2012 (last Friday of February) - EMF
						Query 1.4.2 maintenance release (if necessary)</html:li>
					<html:li>A list of issues indicated for the 1.5.x maintenance
						stream can be found in bugzilla, or by using links on maintenance
						stream build pages.</html:li>

	<target_environments>
		<html:div>
			In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably
			current versions of the underlying operating environments. The EMF
			Query project depends upon on the Platform and other projects, which
			are mostly "pure" Java
			<html:sup>TM</html:sup>
			. The 3.7
			release of the Eclipse Platform Project is written and
			compiled
			against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted
			to run on version 1.5 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard
			Edition. EMF Query will target the same Java version as EMF Core,
			which
			currently requires Java 5. Eclipse Platform SDK 3.7 will be
			tested and
			validated on a number of reference platforms. EMF Query
			will be tested
			and validated against a subset of those listed for the
			platform.
		</html:div>
		<internationalization>
			<html:div>
				The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for
				internationalized products. The user interface elements provided by
				the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages,
				are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default
				resource bundles. As a result, the EMF Query project will provide
				English strings in its default bundles and be localized to a subset
				of those locales offered by the Platform. This plan will be updated
				to indicate which locales will be provided and the time frame for
				availability
          </html:div>
		</internationalization>
	</target_environments>
	<compatibility_with_previous_releases>
		<html:div>
			Compatibility of Release 1.4: The EMF Query project will be developed
			in parallel, and released simultaneously, with the following
			projects. As stated above, each milestone release of the EMF Query
			project will be compatible with the corresponding milestones for each
			of these projects, and delivered the appropriate offset.
			<html:ul>
				<html:li>Eclipse Platform SDK version 3.6</html:li>
				<html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) version 2.7</html:li>
				<html:li>Eclipse MDT OCL version 3.1</html:li>
				<html:li>Eclipse MDT UML2 version 3.2</html:li>
			</html:ul>
			Therefore, the EMF Query initial release will be compatible with
			these versions and will publish binary and source compatibilities
			with migration guides on subsequent releases. The EMF Query 1.5 will
			also include EMF Query2 features which are only additions and hence
			will not cause any incompatibilities.
