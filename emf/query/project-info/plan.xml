   <introduction>
     <html:div>
<html:p>
This document lays out the feature and API set for the
fourth release of the EMF Model Query (EMF MQ)
Project, version 1.3.0. This project plan inherits from the Modeling
Project Plan, which should be referenced when consulting this
individual project plan.
</html:p><html:p>
The intent for this release is to drive development by community contributions.
No new features are planned by the project committers, but patches from the
community will be processed as efficiently as possible.  There is no backlog of
Bugzilla items.  If no new content is committed by the API Freeze date, then
a termination review will be requested for this project.

   <release_deliverables>
     <html:div>
The release deliverables have the same form as is found in most Eclipse projects, namely:
<html:ul>
<html:li>EMF MQ source code release, available as versions tagged "R1_3" in the project's CVS repository.</html:li>
<html:li>EMF MQ SDK (includes runtime, sources, examples, and documentation) (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>EMF MQ runtime binary distribution (downloadable and update site).</html:li>
<html:li>EMF MQ tests (downloadable)</html:li>
</html:ul>
     </html:div>
   </release_deliverables>
   <release_milestones>
      <preamble>
         <html:div>
Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals and follow the
Platform milestone releases by approximately 1 week; that is, until the
final 3.5 release of the Platform, upon which EMF MQ and other projects
will release simultaneously. It is anticipated that EMF MQ will synchronize its
milestones with the Galileo milestone schedule.

EMF MQ will produce maintenance releases to align with the Ganymede SR
releases, that includes the Eclipse Platform 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 releases.
EMF MQ may produce interim maintenance releases in addition to these in
order to satisfy clients requests.  Maintenance releases will only be published
if they have any new fixes to offer.
<html:ul>
  <html:li>Friday, August 15, 2008 - EMF MQ 1.2.1 maintenance release (if necessary)</html:li>
  <html:li>Friday, September 26, 2008 - EMF MQ 1.2.2 maintenance release (Ganymede Service Release 1) (if necessary)</html:li>
  <html:li>Friday, February 27, 2009 - EMF MQ 1.2.3 maintenance release (Ganymede Service Release 2) (if necessary)</html:li>
  <html:li>A list of issues indicated for the 1.2.x maintenance stream can be found in
      bugzilla, or by using links on maintenance stream build pages.</html:li>

   <target_environments>
     <html:div>
In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably
current versions of the underlying operating environments. The EMF Model Query
(EMF MQ) project depends upon on the
Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java<html:sup>TM</html:sup>. The 3.5
release of the Eclipse Platform Project is written and compiled
against version 1.4 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted to run on
version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. EMF MQ
will target the same Java version as EMF Core, which currently requires
Java 5. Eclipse Platform SDK 3.5 will be tested and validated on a
number of reference platforms. EMF MQ will be tested and validated
against a subset of those listed for the platform.
     </html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis
for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided
by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default
resource bundles. As a result, the EMF MQ
project will provide English strings in its default bundles and be
localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Platform. This
plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and
the time frame for availability.
          </html:div>
     </internationalization>
   </target_environments>
   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>
Compatibility of Release 1.3: The EMF MQ project
will be developed in parallel, and released simultaneously, with the
following projects. As stated above, each milestone release of the
EMF MQ project will be compatible with the
corresponding milestones for each of these projects, and delivered the
appropriate offset.
<html:ul>
    <html:li>Eclipse Platform SDK version 3.5</html:li>
    <html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) version 2.5</html:li>
</html:ul>
Therefore, the EMF MQ initial release will be
compatible with these versions and will publish binary and source
compatibilities with migration guides on subsequent releases.

A list of project requirements and agreed upon
implementation time frames is found in this document. For the
milestones listed in this document, a set of overall themes is used
to indicate what major set of functionalities is to be concentrated
on for each. These themes are presented below, while the requirements
document and associated Bugzilla entries are left to those wanting
more detailed information on each.

                <html:div>
The EMF MQ project remains committed to accepting contributions of new features
from the community at large.  Bugzilla items with patches are encouraged, but
other items may be considered at the committers' discretion, according to their
availability.  No committer-driven content is planned.
