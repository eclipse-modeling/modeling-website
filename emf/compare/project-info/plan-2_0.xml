   <introduction>
     <html:div>
This document lays out the feature and API set for the
2.0.0 release of the EMF Compare project.
This project plan inherits from the Modeling Project Plan,
which should be referenced when consulting this individual project plan.

   </introduction>
   <release_deliverables>
     <html:div>
The release deliverables have the same form as is found in most Eclipse projects. Namely:
       <html:ul>
         <html:li>
EMF Compare source code release, 
available as versions tagged with "R2_0" in the project's GIT repository.
         </html:li>
         <html:li>
EMF Compare SDK,
which includes runtime, sources, examples, and documentation,
and is available as a download or on the update site.
         </html:li>
         <html:li>
EMF Compare binary distribution,
available as a download or on the update site.
         </html:li>
       </html:ul>
     </html:div>
   </release_deliverables>
   <release_milestones>
      <preamble>
         <html:div>
The 2.0 release for EMF Compare is planned outside of the platform release train.
It was initially planned to align with the Juno release train, but was postponed
in order not to confuse users as to what was the "Juno" version.

EMF Compare will produce maintenance releases to align with the Juno Service Releases
which includes the Eclipse Platform's 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 releases.<br/>
They will be released a while after the Juno SR release trains in order not to
confuse adopters.<br/>
EMF Compare may produce additional interim maintenance releases.<br/>
Maintenance releases will only be published if they contain new fixes.

    <target_environments>
      <html:div>
In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments. 
The EMF Compare project depends upon on the Platform,which is mostly "pure" Javaâ„¢.The 4.2 release of the Eclipse Platform Project 
is written and compiled against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs,  and targeted to run on version 1.5 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. 
EMF Compare rely on EMF Core which is written and compiled against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs.,
EMF Compare relies on Java 5. 
Eclipse Platform SDK 4.2 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms. 
EMF Compare  will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform.

Given that there is no operating system dependent code in EMF Compare, it's expected that EMF Compare will work anywhere the Eclipse Platform does.
     </html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, 
including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. 
The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles. 
Similarly, the EMF Compare project will externalize all its user interface elements,
provide English strings for them in its default bundles, 
and localize a subset of the locales offered by the Platform. 
The download page will provide the details as the become available.
          </html:div>

   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>
EMF Compare 2.0 is a full re-designing of the project.


Compatibility of Release 1.3.0:<br/>
The EMF Compare project will be developed in parallel, 
and released simultaneously, 
with the following project. 
         <ul>
         <li>
Eclipse Platform SDK version 4.2
           </li>
           <li>
EMF Core 2.8
           </li>
        </ul>
Each milestone version of the EMF Compare project 
will be compatible with the corresponding milestone for this project 
and will be delivered within the appropriate time offset.


The ultimate EMF Compare release will be compatible with the released version of its dependencies
and will publish binary and source compatibilities with migration guides on subsequent releases.

A list of project goals and agreed upon implementation time frames is found in this document.
For the milestones listed in this document, 
a set of overall themes is used to indicate what major set of functionalities is expected to be the focus of each.
These themes are presented below, 
while the goals of the associated Bugzilla entries are available for more detailed information.
