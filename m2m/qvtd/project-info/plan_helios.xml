   <introduction>
     <html:div>
<html:p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the 
first release of the Eclipse QVT Declarative (M2M QVTd) 
Project, version 0.8.0.</html:p>
<html:p>
<html:i><html:b>Note</html:b> that, since the 
<html:a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/08-04-03pdf">OMG QVT 1.0</html:a>
standard suffers from significant ambiguities and conflicts making a compliant implementation impossible,
<html:b>M2M QVTd</html:b>release is best endeavours to establish a coherent interpretation 
of the OMG QVT 1.1 standard.</html:i>

   <target_environments>
     <html:div>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably
 current versions of the underlying operating environments. The Eclipse
 QVT Declarative (M2M QVTd) project depends upon on the
 Platform and other projects, which are mostly "pure" Java. The 3.6
 release of the Eclipse Platform Project is written and compiled
 against version 5.0 of the Java Platform APIs, and targeted to run on
 version 5.0 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. M2 QVTd will target the same Java version as EMF, OCL and UML2, which currently require
 Java 5. Eclipse Platform SDK 3.6 will be tested and validated on a
 number of reference platforms. M2M QVTd will be tested and validated
 against a subset of those listed for the platform.</html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis
 for internationalized products. The user interface elements provided
 by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs and error messages,
are externalized. The English strings are provided as the default
 resource bundles. As a result, the M2M QVTd project will provide English strings in its default bundles and be 
localized to a subset of those locales offered by the Platform. This 
plan will be updated to indicate which locales will be provided and
the time frame for availability.</html:div>
     </internationalization>
   </target_environments>
   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>The M2M QVTd project
 will be developed in parallel, and released simultaneously, with the 
following projects.<html:ul>

    <html:li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) version 2.6</html:li>
    <html:li>Model Development Tools (MDT) UML2 version 3.1</html:li>
    <html:li>Model Development Tools (MDT) OCL version 3.0</html:li>
    <html:li>The IDE Meta-tooling Platform (IMP) version 1.0</html:li>
</html:ul>
<html:p>M2M QVTd 0.7.0 was never formally released with a stable build or update site.</html:p>
