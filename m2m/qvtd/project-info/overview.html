<p>QVT Declarative  is an implementation of the Core (QVTc) and Relations (QVTr) Languages defined by the OMG
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm#MOF_QVT">Query/View/Transformation Specification (QVT)</a>.</p>
<p>(The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=modeling.m2m.qvtoml">QVT Operational</a> component provides an implementation of the QVTo Language.)</p>
<p>The QVT Declarative component provides the following capabilities to support the QVT Declarative Languages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Defines a semantically sensitive editors for QVTc and QVTr.</li>
	<li>Defines an Ecore implementation of the QVT abstract syntax model, including support for
	    serialization of QVT documents.</li>
	<li>Defines an EMOF implementation of the QVT, Essential OCL and Essential MOF abstract syntax models, including support for
	    serialization of QVT documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>The QVTc and QVTr parsers are generated by the LALR Parser Generator, a SourceForge project,
licensed under the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">EPL v1.0</a>.
Download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpg/">LPG home page</a>.
This site includes the generator executable required to regenerate the parser code.</p>
