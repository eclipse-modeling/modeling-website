<p>Xtext is a framework/tool for development of external textual DSLs. Just describe your very own DSL using Xtext's 
	simple EBNF grammar language and the generator will create a parser, an AST-meta model (implemented in EMF) as well 
	as a full-featured Eclipse Text Editor from that.</p>

<p>The Framework integrates with technology from Eclipse Modeling such as EMF, GMF, M2T and parts of EMFT. Development 
with Xtext is optimized for short turn-arounds, so that adding new features to an existing DSL can be done in seconds. 
Still with the new version more sophisticated programming languages can be implemented.</p>
